# Master Orchestrator Session Startup Checklist

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE STARTUP SEQUENCE FOR NEXT CLAUDE SESSION

### Phase 1: Master Orchestrator Self-Registration (Priority 1)
- [ ] **Step 1**: Locate and examine agent registration system in codebase
- [ ] **Step 2**: Register self as "Master Orchestrator Agent"
- [ ] **Step 3**: Create comprehensive agent profile with capabilities
- [ ] **Step 4**: Document registration process for future agents

### Phase 2: Agent Network Discovery & Verification (Priority 1)
- [ ] **VS Code Agents**: Test chat interfaces for Cline, RooCoder, Gemini Code Assist, Copilot
- [ ] **Browser Agents**: Verify access to Gemini, AI Studio, Jules, GitHub Copilot Web
- [ ] **Jules GitHub**: **CRITICAL** - Test repository access and establish coordination protocols
- [ ] **Documentation**: Update agent registry with actual capabilities discovered

### Phase 3: Platform Completion (Priority 2)
- [ ] **Build System**: Complete all package builds and resolve dependencies
- [ ] **Services**: Verify all services start with port management system
- [ ] **Extensions**: Activate Chrome extension and VS Code extension
- [ ] **Relay System**: Connect local relay system to all communication channels

### Phase 4: Multi-Agent Coordination Implementation (Priority 2)
- [ ] **Task Delegation**: Implement workflows for assigning tasks to different agent types
- [ ] **Communication**: Establish real-time coordination protocols
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Create progress tracking and agent performance metrics
- [ ] **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive logs of all agent interactions

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### Jules GitHub Coordination (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- **NEVER** let Jules make uncoordinated commits
- **ALWAYS** use branch naming convention: `jules/[task-description]`
- **MONITOR** all repository changes in real-time
- **COORDINATE** with local development before merging

### Token Efficiency (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **DELEGATE** all implementation tasks to VS Code agents
- **USE** browser agents for planning and analysis
- **PRESERVE** Master Orchestrator context for coordination only
- **TRACK** delegation success rates and optimize

### Documentation Completeness (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **UPDATE** all implementation logs as work progresses
- **MAINTAIN** agent capability registry with real discoveries
- **DOCUMENT** all coordination protocols and lessons learned
- **PREPARE** comprehensive handoff prompt for next session

## 📊 SUCCESS METRICS TO TRACK

### Agent Coordination Metrics
- Number of agents successfully contacted and delegated to
- Task completion success rate across different agent types
- Coordination overhead time vs. productive work time
- Jules GitHub integration conflicts (target: zero)

### Platform Completion Metrics
- Percentage of packages successfully built and running
- Number of services operational with port management
- Communication channels successfully activated
- End-to-end platform functionality verification

### Efficiency Metrics
- Master Orchestrator context preservation (target: >80%)
- Task delegation ratio (target: >80% of implementation tasks)
- Agent response time and reliability
- Overall development velocity improvement

## 🎯 SESSION END CRITERIA

### Minimum Viable Success
- [ ] Master Orchestrator role established and documented
- [ ] At least 3 VS Code agents successfully contacted and tested
- [ ] Jules GitHub coordination protocols established and tested
- [ ] Core platform services running with port management
- [ ] Agent database schema implemented and populated

### Optimal Success
- [ ] All identified agents discovered, tested, and cataloged
- [ ] Complete multi-agent delegation workflows operational
- [ ] Jules successfully completing coordinated GitHub tasks
- [ ] Full platform buildout completed and verified
- [ ] Self-learning agent discovery system implemented

### Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Comprehensive handoff prompt created for next session
- [ ] All agent interactions logged and analyzed
- [ ] Lessons learned documented for bottleneck optimization
- [ ] Updated agent registry with real-world capability assessments

## 🔄 HANDOFF PREPARATION

### Documentation Updates Required
- Update `docs/AVAILABLE_AGENTS_REGISTRY.md` with actual agent capabilities
- Update `docs/MASTER_ORCHESTRATOR_COORDINATION_PROTOCOLS.md` with lessons learned
- Create new session handoff prompt with current status and next priorities
- Maintain implementation logs for all code changes and agent interactions

### Repository Coordination
- Ensure all local changes are committed and documented
- Track any Jules GitHub branches and coordinate integration
- Verify no conflicts between local development and GitHub agent work
- Prepare clean state for next session continuation

### Agent Network Status
- Document which agents are responsive and reliable
- Note any agents that are unavailable or problematic
- Update performance metrics and specialization assessments
- Prepare optimized delegation strategies for next session

This checklist ensures the Master Orchestrator session begins with maximum efficiency and clear objectives while maintaining the critical coordination protocols needed for multi-agent success.
