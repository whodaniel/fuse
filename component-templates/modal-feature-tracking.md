## Usage Analysis

### UI Modal Usage

- Used in 18 components across the application
- Most commonly used for forms and confirmation dialogs
- All size variants are used, with medium being most common
- Focus trap functionality critical for form-based modals

### Core Modal Usage

- Used in 12 components, mostly in older parts of the application
- Primarily used for simple alerts and notifications
- Custom positioning used for specialized UI sections
- Limited accessibility features

### Feature Modal Usage

- Used in 8 components, all within specific feature modules
- Complex animation system used for interactive tutorials
- Custom positioning heavily used for contextual information

## Consolidation Decision

Based on the feature comparison and usage analysis, we will create a consolidated Modal component that:

1. Uses UI Modal as the base implementation
2. Incorporates the complex animations from Feature Modal
3. Integrates the comprehensive positioning system from Feature Modal
4. Maintains backward compatibility with all existing usage patterns

## Migration Plan

1. Create consolidated Modal component in `packages/ui/src/components/Modal.tsx`
2. Add comprehensive tests for all features
3. Update imports in phases, starting with newest components
4. Verify functionality after each batch of updates
5. Document API changes and migration steps

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Unit tests for all size variations
- [ ] Unit tests for backdrop click behavior
- [ ] Unit tests for keyboard escape behavior
- [ ] Unit tests for animations
- [ ] Unit tests for focus trap functionality
- [ ] Unit tests for scrollable content
- [ ] Unit tests for header/footer sections
- [ ] Unit tests for close button
- [ ] Unit tests for body scroll prevention
- [ ] Unit tests for custom positioning
- [ ] Integration tests with forms
- [ ] Integration tests with alerts/notifications
- [ ] Visual regression tests

## Notes

- The Feature Modal has the most advanced animation system
- UI Modal has the best accessibility implementation
- Consider creating a Dialog component that builds on the consolidated Modal
