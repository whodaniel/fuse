# Tech Context

## Technologies Used
- **TypeScript:** Primary language for development.
- **Node.js:** Runtime environment for VSCode extensions.
- **VSCode API:** For interacting with the editor and its features.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** For webview UI.
- (Potentially other libraries/frameworks for UI or specific tasks, to be identified).

## Development Setup
- VSCode as the IDE.
- `npm` or `yarn` for package management (based on `package.json`, `yarn.lock`).
- `esbuild` for bundling (from `esbuild.js`).
- `eslint` for linting (from `eslint.config.mjs`).
- `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript configuration.

## Technical Constraints
- Must operate within the VSCode extension sandbox.
- Performance considerations to avoid impacting editor responsiveness.
- Compatibility with VSCode API versions.

## Dependencies
- Managed via `package.json`. Key dependencies likely include:
    - `@types/vscode` for VSCode API type definitions.
    - (Other dependencies will be apparent from `package.json` and import statements).

## Tool Usage Patterns
- **TypeScript Compiler (`tsc`):** Used for type checking and compilation (implicitly, based on the errors).
- **Bundler (`esbuild`):** To package the extension for distribution/testing.
- **Linter (`eslint`):** For code style and quality checks.
- **Version Control (Git):** Assumed, standard practice (`.gitignore` present).
