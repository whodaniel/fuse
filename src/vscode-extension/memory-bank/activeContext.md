# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The primary focus is to resolve all TypeScript compilation errors to achieve a clean build of the VSCode extension. The user has provided a list of 118 errors across 16 files.

## Recent Changes
- Initial creation of Memory Bank files:
    - `projectbrief.md`
    - `productContext.md`

## Next Steps
1. Systematically address each TypeScript error provided in the user's initial problem statement.
2. Prioritize errors that might have cascading effects or are simpler to fix to build momentum.
3. For each error:
    - Analyze the error message and the relevant code snippet.
    - Determine the root cause.
    - Implement the necessary code changes.
    - Verify the fix (conceptually, as direct compilation is not performed by Cline).
4. After addressing a batch of errors, or a specific file's errors, update `progress.md`.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The large number of errors suggests potential systemic issues, possibly related to type definitions, interface implementations, or recent refactoring.
- Changes to one file (e.g., a type definition in `src/types/`) might resolve errors in multiple other files.
- Need to be careful with changes to private members (e.g., `_view`) and ensure encapsulation is respected or appropriately modified.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Adhere to TypeScript best practices.
- Maintain clear and readable code.
- Ensure changes are localized and minimize side effects where possible.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The project is in a state where significant type-related issues are preventing a successful build.
- A methodical approach to error resolution is required.
