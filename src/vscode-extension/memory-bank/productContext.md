# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
This project aims to create a VSCode extension, "The New Fuse," to improve developer productivity and workflow within the VSCode environment.

## Problems It Solves
The extension intends to address common pain points for developers, potentially including:
- Streamlining repetitive tasks.
- Enhancing code navigation and understanding.
- Integrating useful tools and services directly into the IDE.
- (Specific problems will be further defined as the project evolves)

## How It Should Work
The extension will provide a set of features accessible through the VSCode interface (e.g., commands, views, status bar items). It should be intuitive to use and integrate seamlessly with the existing VSCode experience.

## User Experience Goals
- **Efficiency:** Help users accomplish tasks faster.
- **Clarity:** Provide clear and understandable information and feedback.
- **Reliability:** Function consistently and without errors.
- **Intuitiveness:** Be easy to learn and use.
