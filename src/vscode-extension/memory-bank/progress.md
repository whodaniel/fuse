# Progress

## What Works
- (To be determined after initial error fixing and testing)
- Currently, the extension is likely not buildable or runnable due to the large number of TypeScript errors.

## What's Left to Build/Fix
- **Immediate:** Resolve 118 TypeScript errors across 16 files.
    - `src/extension.ts` (18 errors)
    - `src/llm/LLMProviderManager.ts` (2 errors)
    - `src/llm/providers/anthropic-provider.ts` (3 errors)
    - `src/llm/providers/cerebras-provider.ts` (3 errors)
    - `src/llm/providers/openai-provider.ts` (1 error)
    - `src/llm/providers/vscode-llm-provider.ts` (12 errors)
    - `src/mcp/EnhancedModelContextProtocolClient.ts` (11 errors)
    - `src/services/LLMMonitoringService.ts` (6 errors)
    - `src/services/RooIntegration.ts` (1 error)
    - `src/services/WebviewMessageRouter.ts` (18 errors)
    - `src/views/ChatViewProvider.ts` (20 errors)
    - `src/views/CommunicationHubProvider.ts` (4 errors)
    - `src/views/DashboardProvider.ts` (1 error)
    - Errors in `node_modules` (18 errors) - these are likely due to issues in the local codebase or type inconsistencies, not direct modification of `node_modules`.
- **Future:**
    - Define and implement core features of "The New Fuse" extension.
    - Testing and quality assurance.
    - Documentation.

## Current Status
- **Overall:** Project is in a state requiring significant error correction before development can proceed.
- **Memory Bank:** Initialized with core files.

## Known Issues
- 118 TypeScript compilation errors as listed by the user.
- The root causes of these errors are yet to be investigated individually.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Decision (Initial):** Prioritize fixing all TypeScript errors to establish a stable baseline.
- **Decision (Initial):** Create and maintain a Memory Bank for project context due to session memory resets.
