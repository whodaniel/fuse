# Migration Plan for "The New Fuse" Extension

## Overview

This document outlines the systematic migration of components from the old VS Code extension to the new project structure, focusing on one feature at a time while making improvements and fixes along the way.

## Migration Priorities

1. **Core Infrastructure**
   - Extension activation and command registration
   - Basic UI components and views
   - LLM Provider integration

2. **Feature Migration Sequence**
   - Chat view and functionality
   - Provider management (including fallback mechanisms)
   - MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration
   - Agent communication
   - Monitoring and telemetry
   - Additional UI enhancements

## Component Migration Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Extension Activation | ‚úÖ | Basic structure in place |
| ChatViewProvider | ‚úÖ | Implemented with button visibility fixes |
| LLMProviderManager | ‚úÖ | Migrated with rate limit handling improvements |
| Model Context Protocol | ‚úÖ | Enhanced implementation with reconnection and HTTP fallback |
| Agent Communication | ‚è±Ô∏è | Pending |
| Monitoring Service | üîÑ | Partial implementation |
| UI Enhancements | üîÑ | Ongoing improvements |

## Next Steps

1. Finish any remaining work on LLMProviderManager's rate limit detection
2. Ensure robust ChatViewProvider button visibility under all conditions
3. Test Enhanced MCP client with real server connections
4. Migrate Agent Communication components
5. Enhance error handling and user feedback throughout
6. Improve monitoring and telemetry capabilities

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Button Visibility**: Implemented multiple fallback mechanisms for codicon loading issues
- **LLM Rate Limits**: Added robust provider fallback with user notification
- **Cross-component Communication**: Using VS Code commands for component communication
- **MCP Connectivity**: Implemented robust reconnection logic and HTTP transport fallback

## Testing Strategy

Each migrated component should be tested both in isolation and as part of the integrated extension, focusing on:

1. Core functionality matching the original extension
2. Error handling and edge cases
3. UI/UX improvements
4. Performance and reliability
