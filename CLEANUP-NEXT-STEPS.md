# Next Steps for The New Fuse Cleanup

Based on the large number of potential cleanup targets identified, we need a systematic approach to handle them effectively.

## Immediate Actions

1. **Run the Summary Analysis Script**
   ```bash
   node scripts/cleanup-summary.js
   ```
   This will generate a prioritized cleanup plan in `CLEANUP-PRIORITIZED.md`.

2. **Evaluate High-Priority Items First**
   Review the high-priority unused imports and files identified in the summary.
   These represent the core areas where cleanup will have the most impact.

3. **Address Directory Hot Spots**
   Start with directories that have the most unused files, as these may represent
   obsolete modules or features that can be removed entirely.

## Recommended Approach

### 1. Create a Sprint Planning Document

Break down the cleanup work into manageable sprints:

- **Sprint 1**: High-priority unused imports (2 days)
- **Sprint 2**: Top 3 directories with unused files (2 days)
- **Sprint 3**: High-priority unused files (2 days)
- **Sprint 4**: Remaining cleanup and final testing (1-2 days)

### 2. Use the Incremental Implementation Pattern

For each targeted file:

1. Create a backup (automated by our scripts)
2. Verify the file is truly unused
3. Make changes and run relevant tests
4. Document the changes in the commit message

### 3. Establish a Review Protocol

For each batch of changes:

1. Have another team member review the changes
2. Run the full test suite
3. Deploy to a staging environment
4. Monitor for any issues before proceeding

## Dealing with False Positives

The analysis has identified a large number of potentially unused files and imports, many of which are likely false positives due to:

1. Dynamic imports and references
2. Build and bundling processes
3. Type declarations and interfaces
4. Special modules loaded for side effects

To address this:

1. **Start conservatively** - Focus on the most confident detections first
2. **Use code coverage tools** to supplement the analysis
3. **Monitor application behavior** closely after each change

## Long-Term Cleanup Strategy

After completing the immediate cleanup:

1. **Implement better import practices**
   - Use named exports instead of default exports
   - Avoid side-effect imports
   - Create proper index files for modules

2. **Adopt a code ownership model**
   - Assign owners to directories/modules 
   - Owners are responsible for keeping their code clean

3. **Setup automated checks**
   - Add unused import/file detection to CI
   - Block PRs that introduce unused code

Remember, the goal is to improve maintainability and performance, not just to remove code.
Focus on quality over quantity, and prioritize the changes that will have the most impact.

## Execution Summary

Proceed with the cleanup process by running the following commands:

1. **Initialize the Cleanup Environment**
   ```bash
   node scripts/run-now.js
   ```
2. **Perform Final Cleanup**
   ```bash
   node scripts/final-cleanup.js
   ```
3. **Analyze Results and Update Dashboard**
   ```bash
   node scripts/analyze-results.js
   node scripts/update-progress.js
   ```
4. **Review Reports**
   - Check the generated reports under the `reports/` folder, including:
     - `cleanup-results.txt`
     - `dependencies-report.json`
     - `analysis-summary.json`
     - `cleanup-action-plan.md`
