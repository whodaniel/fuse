✅ yarn dev:chrome         # Development with watching
✅ yarn test:chrome        # Run extension tests
✅ yarn package:chrome     # Create distribution package
✅ yarn release:chrome     # Build and package for release
✅ yarn clean:chrome       # Clean build artifacts
```

### Integration Points
- **Turbo Build System:** Chrome extension integrated with existing builds
- **Shared Dependencies:** Webpack tools shared across workspaces
- **Unified Testing:** Extension tests run with project test suite
- **Coordinated Releases:** Extension packaging aligned with project versioning

## 🎯 Deployment Ready

npm install  # or yarn install
./build.sh
# Manual packaging
# Separate dependency management
```

### After Workspace Integration
```bash
# Single command from anywhere in project
yarn build:chrome  # or yarn build:all
# Automatic packaging available
# Unified dependency management
# Coordinated with main project builds
```
