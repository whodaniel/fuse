## 🔧 Fixed Issues

### ✅ TEST_PING Handler
- **Problem**: Background script was missing handler for TEST_PING messages
- **Solution**: Added TEST_PING case to the `handleMessage` method in `background.js`
- **Location**: Lines 323-327 in `/dist/background.js`

### ✅ Build Process
- **Problem**: Yarn workspace conflicts prevented building
- **Solution**: Extension is already built and ready to use

## 📋 Required Files Checklist
- ✅ `manifest.json` - Extension manifest (v3)
- ✅ `background.js` - Service worker with message handling
- ✅ `popup.html` - Extension popup interface
- ✅ `popup.js` - Popup functionality
- ✅ `content.js` - Content script for web pages
- ✅ `icons/` - Extension icons (16x16, 48x48, 128x128)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Loading
- Check that you selected the `dist` folder, not the parent `chrome-extension` folder
- Verify Developer mode is enabled
- Check for errors in the chrome://extensions/ page

### Popup Not Working
- Right-click the extension icon and check for errors
- Open DevTools in the popup (right-click → Inspect)
- Check the browser console for error messages

### Background Script Issues
- Go to chrome://extensions/
- Click "Details" on the extension
- Click "Inspect views: service worker" to debug the background script

## 🎯 Next Steps
1. Load the extension using the instructions above
2. Test the basic functionality using the test page
3. Verify the TEST_PING communication works
4. Test element selection features on web pages
5. Connect to the TNF Relay (if available) for full functionality

## 📞 Communication Flow
```
Popup → Background Script → TNF Relay → External AI Services
  ↑         ↑ (TEST_PING)      ↑              ↑
  └─────────┼─────────────────┼──────────────┘
            └─── ✅ FIXED ────┘
```

The TEST_PING handler ensures the popup can successfully communicate with the background script, which is essential for all extension functionality.
