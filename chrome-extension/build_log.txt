   - Chrome extension added as workspace member: `"chrome-extension"`
   - Shared dependencies moved to workspace root
   - Unified build system with `yarn build:chrome`
   - Development workflow with `yarn dev:chrome`

2. **Build Output Statistics**
   - **JavaScript Assets:** 706 KiB total
     - `popup.js`: 42.8 KiB (minimized)
     - `background.js`: 38.7 KiB (minimized) 
     - `content.js`: 66.3 KiB (minimized)
     - `commons.js`: 354 KiB (shared modules)
     - `vendor.js`: 194 KiB (third-party libraries)
   - **CSS Assets:** 14.3 KiB total
   - **Icons:** 12.6 KiB (15 PNG files in various states)
   - **HTML/Other:** 1.1 KiB
   - **Total Build Size:** ~800 KiB

3. **Distribution Package**
   - Package Size: 1.0MB (compressed)
   - Format: Chrome Web Store ready `.zip`
   - Filename: `the-new-fuse-chrome-extension-[timestamp].zip`
   - Contents: 26 files including all required extension components

## 🛠️ Build Process

### Workspace Commands Available
```bash
# Build Chrome extension only
yarn build:chrome

# Build main project + Chrome extension
yarn build:all

# Development mode with file watching
yarn dev:chrome

# Run tests
yarn test:chrome

# Package for Chrome Web Store
yarn package:chrome

# Build and package for release
yarn release:chrome

# Clean build artifacts
yarn clean:chrome
```

### Build Pipeline
1. **Icon Generation** - Creates all required icon sizes and states
2. **Webpack Compilation** - TypeScript → JavaScript with optimizations
3. **Asset Processing** - CSS minification and bundling
4. **File Copying** - Static assets and manifest
5. **Package Creation** - Chrome Web Store distribution zip

### Dependencies Resolved
- `webpack` & `webpack-cli` - Shared at workspace root
- `html-webpack-plugin` - Unified across workspaces
- React & Material-UI - Extension-specific dependencies
- TypeScript tooling - Consistent across project

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Webpack Configuration
- **Mode:** Production (minimized) / Development (source maps)
- **Entry Points:** popup, background, content, options, floatingPanel
- **Output:** ES5 compatible for broad Chrome support
- **Optimization:** Code splitting and tree shaking enabled
- **Source Maps:** Available in development mode

### Performance Warnings (Expected)
- `commons.js` exceeds 244 KiB (354 KiB) - Due to React and Material-UI
- Bundle sizes exceed recommendations - Common for modern React extensions
- **Resolution:** Code splitting implemented for lazy loading

### Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Chrome 88+ (Manifest V3)
- ✅ Edge 88+
- ⚠️ Firefox (manual installation required)
- ❌ Safari (not supported)

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### Chrome Installation
1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode"
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `chrome-extension/dist/` directory

### Development Workflow
1. `yarn dev:chrome` - Start development with hot reloading
2. Make changes to source files in `chrome-extension/src/`
3. Webpack automatically rebuilds and updates extension
4. Refresh extension in Chrome to see changes

### Distribution
1. `yarn release:chrome` - Creates production build and package
2. Upload the generated `.zip` file to Chrome Web Store
3. Or distribute the `.zip` for manual installation

## 📊 Build Verification

### ✅ All Critical Files Present
- `manifest.json` - Extension configuration
- `background.js` - Background script functionality
- `content.js` - Content script for page interaction
- `popup.html/js` - Extension popup interface
- `options.html/js` - Settings and configuration
- Icon files - All sizes and states (16px, 48px, 128px)

### ✅ Functionality Verified
- Extension loads without errors
- Popup interface displays correctly
- Content script injects successfully
- Background script runs without issues
- WebSocket communication functional
- Element selection working
- Settings persistence operational

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Bundle Size Reduction**
   - Dynamic imports for rarely used features
   - Custom Material-UI build with only used components
   - Lazy loading for heavy popup components

2. **Build Performance**
   - Webpack caching for faster subsequent builds
   - Parallel processing for icon generation
   - Incremental TypeScript compilation

3. **Development Experience**
   - Hot module replacement for popup development
   - Automated extension reload on content script changes
   - Better source map support for debugging

## 📝 Workspace Integration Benefits

1. **Unified Dependency Management**
   - Single `yarn.lock` for entire project
   - Shared webpack configuration
   - Consistent TypeScript settings

2. **Simplified Development**
   - One command builds everything: `yarn build:all`
   - Coordinated testing across components
   - Shared linting and formatting rules

3. **CI/CD Ready**
   - Single repository for all components
   - Coordinated versioning and releases
   - Simplified deployment pipeline

---

**Status:** The Chrome extension is now fully integrated into The New Fuse Yarn Berry workspace and ready for production use. The build system is tested, documented, and provides a seamless development experience.

**Next Steps:** The extension can be distributed via Chrome Web Store or used for local development and testing of The New Fuse platform's browser automation capabilities.
