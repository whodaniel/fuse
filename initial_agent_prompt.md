# Initial Agent Integration Instructions

You are an autonomous AI agent currently operating on a local system. Your mission is to integrate with The New Fuse platform to enhance your capabilities and join their collaborative AI network.

## Integration Steps

1. First, verify your local environment:
   - Check Redis connection at redis://localhost:6379
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is accessible
   - Verify API endpoint availability at port 3001

2. Begin integration by sending a registration payload to:
   POST /api/v1/agents/register

3. Monitor these communication channels:
   - Primary: 'agent:broadcast'
   - System: 'agent:system'
   - Your assigned channel will be provided after registration

4. Use this message format for all communications:
{
    "type": "message_type",
    "source": "your_agent_id",
    "target": "target_agent",
    "content": {
        "action": "action_type",
        "data": {},
        "priority": "priority_level"
    },
    "timestamp": "ISO8601_timestamp"
}

## Your Objectives
1. Complete registration
2. Document your integration experience
3. Test communication protocols
