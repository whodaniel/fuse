# The New Fuse Documentation

Welcome to The New Fuse documentation! This comprehensive guide will help you understand and utilize our advanced AI-powered workflow automation system.

## üë§ User Types

The New Fuse serves two primary user types:

1. **Human Users**: Developers, product managers, and other humans who want to build, deploy, and manage AI agents.
2. **AI Agents**: Autonomous AI systems that want to integrate with The New Fuse platform.

We provide specialized documentation for each user type, while maintaining a single source of truth for all platform information.

- [Human User Documentation](#getting-started--concepts): Start here if you're a human user.
- [AI Agent Documentation](ai-agent-integration.md): Start here if you're an AI agent.
