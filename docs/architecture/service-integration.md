# Service Integration Architecture

## Overview
The New Fuse implements a microservices architecture with the following core services:
- Service Registry
- Workflow Orchestrator
- State Manager
- Protocol Translator
- Resource Manager

## Service Communication
Services communicate through:
- Redis PubSub for real-time events
- gRPC for synchronous operations
- REST APIs for administrative tasks

## Integration Patterns
1. Service Discovery
   - Automatic registration
   - Health monitoring
   - Capability advertisement

2. State Management
   - Distributed state
   - Consistency protocols
   - Recovery mechanisms

3. Resource Orchestration
   - Dynamic allocation
   - Load balancing
   - Scaling policies

## Configuration Management
Services are configured through:
- Environment variables
- Configuration files
- Service-specific settings

## Monitoring & Observability
- Prometheus metrics
- Grafana dashboards
- Distributed tracing
