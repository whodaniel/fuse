# Architectural Refactoring Documentation

## Overview

This document tracks the architectural changes implemented as part of "The New Fuse" project refactoring effort. The primary goals of this refactoring are:

1. Consolidate protocol implementations
2. Separate MCP and A2A concerns
3. Implement type-safe messaging
4. Centralize configuration management
5. Create a unified agent registry
6. Establish a comprehensive testing framework

## Change Log

### 2025-04-28: Core Protocol Layer Implementation

Implemented the foundational components of the new architecture:

- **ICommunicationProtocol interface**: Created a standardized interface for all communication protocols
- **FileCommunicationProtocol**: Implemented file-based communication adapter
- **RedisCommunicationProtocol**: Implemented Redis-based communication adapter
- **ProtocolFactory**: Created a factory for instantiating protocol implementations
- **Test framework**: Added tests for FileCommunicationProtocol

### 2025-04-28: Service Layer Separation

Implemented clear separation between different communication paradigms:

- **A2AService**: Service for agent-to-agent communication
- **MCPService**: Service for agent-tool interactions via Model Context Protocol
- **MessageRouter**: Service for routing messages between A2A and MCP systems

### 2025-04-28: Type Definitions & Validation

Added comprehensive type definitions for messages:

- **Message type interfaces**: Created type-safe interfaces for all message types
- **Type guards**: Implemented runtime type checking for message validation

### 2025-04-28: Configuration Management

Implemented a centralized configuration system:

- **ConfigService**: Provides access to configuration with environment and file-based overrides
- **Default configuration**: Established sensible defaults for all settings

### 2025-04-28: Agent Registry Implementation

Created a centralized agent registry:

- **AgentRegistry**: Service for registering, discovering, and managing agents
- **Agent types and status enums**: Standardized agent classifications
- **Capability discovery**: Implemented capability-based agent discovery
- **Tests**: Added comprehensive test suite for AgentRegistry

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision 1: Protocol Abstraction

**Context**: The existing codebase had multiple overlapping implementations of communication protocols.

**Decision**: Created a unified ICommunicationProtocol interface that all protocol implementations must adhere to.

**Consequences**: 
- Positive: Consistent API across all protocols
- Positive: Ability to swap protocols without changing higher-level code
- Positive: Simplified testing with protocol mockability
- Negative: Slight overhead for simple use cases

### Decision 2: Service Layer Separation

**Context**: The codebase mixed agent-to-agent (A2A) communication with agent-tool (MCP) communication.

**Decision**: Created separate services for A2A and MCP with a MessageRouter to coordinate between them.

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Clear separation of concerns
- Positive: Easier to reason about each communication type
- Positive: Better alignment with protocol specifications
- Negative: Additional coordination layer adds complexity

### Decision 3: Centralized Configuration

**Context**: Configuration was scattered across multiple files with no standardized access pattern.

**Decision**: Implemented a centralized ConfigService with environment variable support and defaults.

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Single source of truth for configuration
- Positive: Environment-specific configuration is easier
- Positive: Sensible defaults reduce configuration burden
- Negative: Requires updating existing code to use the new service

### Decision 4: Agent Registry

**Context**: Agent registration and discovery was ad-hoc and inconsistent.

**Decision**: Created a centralized AgentRegistry for managing agent metadata and capabilities.

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Simplified agent discovery
- Positive: Standardized agent metadata
- Positive: Capability-based routing is now possible
- Negative: Introduces singleton pattern which requires careful management

## Next Steps

1. **Documentation Updates**: Create detailed API documentation for new components
2. **Message Validation**: Implement Zod schema validation for runtime message checking
3. **Component Cleanup**: Begin systematically removing unused components
4. **Integration Testing**: Create end-to-end tests for full communication flows
5. **Migration Guide**: Document migration path from old architecture to new

## Appendix: Technical Debt Items

1. **WebSocketCommunicationProtocol**: Needs to be implemented to complete protocol trio
2. **Authentication Integration**: Current implementation doesn't handle authentication
3. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling strategy
4. **Logging**: Add structured logging throughout the system
5. **Performance Testing**: Benchmark protocol implementations
