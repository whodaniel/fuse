# Monitoring & Metrics

## Available Dashboards

### Service Health Dashboard
Monitors overall service health:
- Service availability
- Response times
- Error rates
- Resource utilization

### Workflow Dashboard
Tracks workflow execution:
- Active workflows
- Completion rates
- Error distribution
- Performance metrics

### Resource Dashboard
Monitors system resources:
- CPU usage
- Memory utilization
- Network throughput
- Disk usage

## Metrics Collection
- Prometheus endpoints
- Custom metrics
- Alert configurations
- Retention policies

## Alert Configuration
- Service degradation
- Resource exhaustion
- Error thresholds
- Recovery actions

## Monitoring Procedures

### Daily Checks

```bash
# Check system health
./scripts/health-check.sh

# View error logs
./scripts/view-errors.sh

# Check metrics
curl http://localhost:9090/metrics
```

### Performance Analysis

```bash
# Generate performance report
./scripts/analyze-performance.sh

# Check slow queries
./scripts/analyze-queries.sh
```

### Capacity Planning

Monitor these thresholds:
- CPU: 80% utilization
- Memory: 85% usage
- Disk: 90% full
- Network: 70% bandwidth

## Alert Response

### Critical Alerts

1. High Error Rate
```bash
# Check error logs
./scripts/error-analysis.sh

# Restart service if needed
docker-compose restart api
```

2. Database Issues
```bash
# Check database health
./scripts/db-health.sh

# Analyze slow queries
./scripts/analyze-slow-queries.sh
```

3. Memory Issues
```bash
# Check memory usage
./scripts/memory-analysis.sh

# Clear caches if needed
./scripts/clear-caches.sh
```
