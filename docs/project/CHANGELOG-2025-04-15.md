## Technical Updates

### Infrastructure
- Added WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Enhanced database schema for workflow storage
- Added support for workflow execution history

### Dependencies
- Added Zod for schema validation
- Added RxJS for reactive programming
- Added Dagre for workflow layout optimization

## Usage

### Workflow Templates
```typescript
// Apply a workflow template
const template = workflowTemplates.find(t => t.id === 'agent-collaboration');
handleImportTemplate(template);
```

### Debugging Workflows
```typescript
// Enable debug mode
workflowExecutionService.setDebugOptions({
  enabled: true,
  stepByStep: true,
  breakpoints: ['node-1', 'node-2'],
  logLevel: 'debug'
});

// Continue execution
workflowExecutionService.continueExecution();
```

### A2A Communication
```typescript
// Create and send an A2A message
const message = a2aProtocolService.createMessage(
  'TASK_REQUEST',
  { task: 'analyze-data' },
  'workflow',
  'agent-1',
  { protocolVersion: '2.0' }
);

await a2aProtocolService.sendMessage(message);
```

## Configuration

### Workflow Builder Configuration
```typescript
// Configure the workflow builder
const config = {
  ui: {
    showGrid: true,
    showMinimap: true,
    defaultNodeWidth: 200,
    defaultNodeHeight: 100
  },
  features: {
    enableDebugging: true,
    enableTemplates: true,
    enableSubworkflows: true
  }
};
```

## Notes
- The workflow builder now supports nested workflows
- A2A communication supports multiple protocol versions
- Execution engine supports retry policies and error handling
- UI is now fully configurable

## Next Steps
1. Implement more workflow templates
2. Enhance A2A protocol with more message types
3. Add support for custom node types
4. Improve analytics visualization
