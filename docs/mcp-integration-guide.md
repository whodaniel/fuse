# MCP Integration Guide

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for AI models to access tools and capabilities. This document explains how GitHub Copilot and other AI models access MCP according to the most recent protocol standards, and details the configuration needed for The New Fuse VS Code extension.

## How GitHub Copilot Accesses MCP

GitHub Copilot accesses MCP services according to the Model Context Protocol standards primarily through:

1. **VS Code Extension Infrastructure**: Copilot integrates with the VS Code extension ecosystem to access MCP tools. The extension itself handles the communication with MCP servers according to the protocol.

2. **Tool Calling Framework**: When Copilot needs to use an MCP capability, it uses a standardized tool calling framework that follows the MCP specification for requests and responses.

3. **Client-Server Architecture**: According to the protocol standards, Copilot acts as an MCP client that makes requests to MCP servers. These servers implement specific capabilities that Copilot can invoke.

4. **JSON-RPC Based Communication**: The actual communication follows JSON-RPC patterns defined in the MCP specification, with requests containing:
   - A method name
   - Parameters specific to the method
   - A unique request ID

5. **Capability Discovery**: Copilot can dynamically discover available MCP capabilities from registered servers.

The current standard allows both direct capability invocation and tool-based interactions, with Copilot primarily using the tool-based approach where MCP servers are registered as tools that can be called with specific parameters.

## Configuration Issues Found and Fixed

The following issues were found and fixed in the MCP configuration:

1. **Duplicate Server Names**: 
   - Several servers appeared in both the "servers" and "mcpServers" sections with the same name
   - Fixed by renaming entries in mcpServers section to:
     - `the-new-fuse-mcp-server` (was "the-new-fuse-mcp")
     - `postgres-mcp` (was "postgres")
     - `brave-search-mcp` (was "brave-search")

2. **Import Path Issues**:
   - The MCP integration module is imported in extension.js from "./mcp-integration", but the actual file is at "./src/mcp-integration.ts"
   - Fixed by updating the import path to correctly reference the module

3. **Missing Initialization**:
   - Added proper initialization of the MCP integration in the extension's activate function
   - Included error handling for MCP initialization failures

## MCP Protocol Command Implementation

The MCP Protocol Manager in this project implements several core commands:

1. **mcp.core.discover**: Lists all registered AI agents in the system
2. **mcp.core.getCapabilities**: Retrieves the capabilities of a specific agent
3. **mcp.core.echo**: Simple ping/echo handler for testing connectivity

The VS Code extension registers these commands:

1. **thefuse.mcp.registerHandler**: Registers a new MCP handler
2. **thefuse.mcp.sendMessage**: Sends an MCP message to a recipient
3. **thefuse.mcp.startAutoDiscovery**: Triggers automatic discovery of AI agents
4. **thefuse.mcp.testTool**: Tests a specific MCP tool (placeholder UI)
5. **thefuse.mcp.showTools**: Shows available MCP tools

## MCP Server Configuration

The project includes the following MCP servers:

1. **the-new-fuse-mcp-server**: Main MCP server for The New Fuse with file, build, and agent coordination capabilities
2. **filesystem**: Provides file system operations
3. **brave-search-mcp**: Offers web search capabilities through the Brave Search API
4. **postgres-mcp**: Provides PostgreSQL database operations
5. **vector-db**: Implements vector database capabilities for AI embeddings
6. **context7-server**: Provides context management capabilities
7. **applescript_execute**: Allows executing AppleScript on macOS
8. **mcp-config-manager**: Manages MCP configuration
9. **browsermcp**: Provides browser automation capabilities
10. **MCP_DOCKER**: Docker integration for MCP

## Testing MCP Servers

To test the MCP servers:

1. Use the "MCP Complete Setup" task to initialize the MCP environment:
   ```
   bash scripts/mcp-setup.sh
   ```

2. Use the "Initialize MCP Integration" task to register the MCP servers:
   ```
   bash scripts/initialize-mcp.sh
   ```

3. Use the "Show MCP Tools" task to view available MCP tools

4. Use the "Test MCP Tool" task to test a specific MCP tool

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

1. **Standardize Error Handling**: Implement consistent error handling for MCP requests to make debugging easier

2. **Enhanced Logging**: Add comprehensive logging for MCP interactions including request/response details and performance metrics

3. **Implement Tool Testing UI**: Complete the implementation of the tool testing UI with visual feedback and test results

4. **Server Health Monitoring**: Add health checks for MCP servers with automatic recovery

5. **Security Enhancements**: Implement more robust authentication and authorization for MCP interactions

6. **Documentation Generator**: Create an automatic documentation generator for available MCP tools and capabilities

7. **MCP Server Registry**: Implement a central registry for MCP servers to simplify discovery and connection

8. **Performance Metrics**: Add performance tracking for MCP requests to identify bottlenecks

9. **Integration Tests**: Create automated tests for MCP server functionality

10. **Configuration Validator**: Add a tool to validate MCP configuration files
