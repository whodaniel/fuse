# The New Fuse Workflow System Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the workflow system in The New Fuse framework, including concepts, examples, and best practices.

## Overview

The Workflow System is a core component of The New Fuse that enables the orchestration of complex interactions between multiple AI agents. It allows you to define, manage, and execute sequences of operations that leverage the capabilities of different agents to achieve sophisticated tasks.

## Key Concepts

### Workflow

A workflow is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of steps that defines a process. Each workflow has:

- **Unique Identifier**: A unique ID for reference
- **Name and Description**: Human-readable identification
- **Steps**: The individual operations in the workflow
- **Triggers**: Events that can initiate the workflow
- **State**: Runtime information during execution

### Steps

Steps are individual units of work within a workflow:

- **Agent Assignment**: Each step is executed by a specific agent
- **Action**: The capability and operation to perform
- **Inputs and Outputs**: Data flow between steps
- **Conditions**: Rules for step execution
- **Error Handling**: Strategies for failure scenarios

### Data Flow

Data flows through a workflow via:

- **Inputs**: Data provided when the workflow starts
- **Outputs**: Data produced when the workflow completes
- **Intermediate Values**: Data passed between steps
- **Context**: Shared information accessible to multiple steps

## Creating Workflows

### Using the API

```javascript
// Create a new workflow via API
const workflow = await client.workflows.create({
  name: "Content Generation Pipeline",
  description: "Generates and validates content",
  steps: [
    {
      name: "Topic Research",
      agentId: "agent-123",
      action: "research-topic",
      inputs: [
        {
          name: "topic",
          source: "input",
          key: "topic"
        }
      ],
      outputs: [
        {
          name: "researchResults",
          destination: "workflow",
          key: "research"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      name: "Content Generation",
      agentId: "agent-456",
      action: "generate-content",
      inputs: [
        {
          name: "research",
          source: "workflow",
          key: "research"
        }
      ],
      outputs: [
        {
          name: "content",
          destination: "output",
          key: "generatedContent"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  triggers: [
    {
      type: "api",
      name: "API Trigger"
    }
  ]
});
```

### Using the Dashboard

1. Navigate to the Workflows section in the dashboard
2. Click "Create New Workflow"
3. Provide a name and description
4. Add steps using the visual editor:
   - Drag agents from the sidebar
   - Configure actions, inputs, and outputs
   - Connect steps to establish data flow
5. Add triggers for workflow activation
6. Save the workflow

## Workflow Execution

### Execution Lifecycle

1. **Initialization**: Workflow inputs are validated
2. **Step Execution**: Steps are executed in dependency order
3. **Data Transfer**: Data flows between steps
4. **Completion**: Final outputs are produced
5. **Cleanup**: Resources are released

### Execution Modes

- **Synchronous**: Execution completes before response
- **Asynchronous**: Execution continues after initial response
- **Scheduled**: Execution occurs at specified times
- **Event-Driven**: Execution triggered by external events

### Example: Execute a Workflow

```javascript
// Execute a workflow synchronously
const result = await client.workflows.executeSync("workflow-123", {
  inputs: {
    topic: "Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare",
    style: "academic"
  }
});

// Execute a workflow asynchronously
const execution = await client.workflows.execute("workflow-123", {
  inputs: {
    topic: "Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare",
    style: "academic"
  }
});

// Check execution status
const status = await client.workflows.getExecutionStatus(execution.executionId);
```

## Advanced Features

### Conditional Execution

Steps can be conditionally executed based on data or previous results:

```javascript
{
  name: "Content Review",
  agentId: "agent-789",
  action: "review-content",
  condition: {
    type: "expression",
    expression: "inputs.content.length > 1000"
  },
  // Other step properties
}
```

### Error Handling

Workflows can define error handling strategies:

```javascript
{
  name: "Content Generation",
  agentId: "agent-456",
  action: "generate-content",
  errorHandling: {
    strategy: "retry",
    maxRetries: r3,
    backoffFactor: 2,
    fallbackStep: "fallback-generation"
  },
  // Other step properties
}
```

### Parallel Execution

Steps can be executed in parallel:

```javascript
{
  name: "Content Analysis",
  type: "parallel",
  branches: [
    {
      name: "Sentiment Analysis",
      agentId: "agent-123",
      action: "analyze-sentiment"
    },
    {
      name: "Topic Classification",
      agentId: "agent-456",
      action: "classify-topics"
    }
  ],
  mergeStrategy: "combine-objects"
}
```

### Timeouts and Limits

Control execution time and resource usage:

```javascript
{
  name: "Research Generation",
  agentId: "agent-123",
  action: "generate-research",
  timeout: 60000, // 60 seconds
  resourceLimits: {
    maxTokens: 8000,
    maxComputeUnits: 10
  }
}
```

## Workflow Templates

The New Fuse includes pre-built workflow templates for common scenarios:

1. **Content Generation Pipeline**
   - Research → Draft → Review → Revise → Publish

2. **Data Analysis Workflow**
   - Extract → Clean → Analyze → Visualize → Report

3. **Code Review Automation**
   - Scan → Analyze → Suggest → Test → Report

4. **Customer Support Automation**
   - Categorize → Research → Generate Response → Human Review → Send

To use a template:

1. Navigate to Templates in the Workflows section
2. Select a template
3. Customize for your specific use case
4. Save as a new workflow

## Best Practices

### Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each step should do one thing well
2. **Idempotency**: Steps should be safe to re-run
3. **Resilience**: Handle failures gracefully
4. **Observability**: Include monitoring points
5. **Versioning**: Version workflows for reproducibility

### Performance Optimization

1. **Minimize Data Transfer**: Only pass necessary data between steps
2. **Parallelize**: Execute independent steps concurrently
3. **Caching**: Cache intermediate results when appropriate
4. **Resource Allocation**: Allocate resources based on step requirements
5. **Batching**: Batch similar operations

### Security Considerations

1. **Least Privilege**: Agents should have minimal required permissions
2. **Data Sanitization**: Validate and sanitize all inputs
3. **Audit Logging**: Log all executions for audit purposes
4. **Access Control**: Restrict workflow access appropriately
5. **Data Privacy**: Handle sensitive data according to policies

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Monitoring Dashboards

The dashboard provides real-time insights:

1. **Execution Status**: Current state of all workflows
2. **Performance Metrics**: Execution time, success rates
3. **Resource Usage**: Compute and memory consumption
4. **Error Rates**: Frequency and types of failures
5. **Agent Utilization**: Load on different agents

### Debugging Tools

When troubleshooting workflow issues:

1. **Execution Logs**: Detailed logs of each step
2. **Input/Output Inspector**: Examine data between steps
3. **Visual Execution Path**: See which steps were executed
4. **Error Details**: Comprehensive error information
5. **Execution Replay**: Replay workflows with same inputs

## Integration Examples

### Integration with External Systems

```javascript
// Step that calls an external API
{
  name: "Fetch External Data",
  agentId: "http-connector",
  action: "http-request",
  inputs: [
    {
      name: "url",
      value: "https://api.example.com/data"
    },
    {
      name: "method",
      value: "GET"
    },
    {
      name: "headers",
      value: {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${workflow.secrets.API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  ],
  outputs: [
    {
      name: "response",
      destination: "workflow",
      key: "externalData"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Integration with Database Systems

```javascript
// Step that queries a database
{
  name: "Retrieve Customer Data",
  agentId: "database-connector",
  action: "execute-query",
  inputs: [
    {
      name: "connection",
      value: "main-database"
    },
    {
      name: "query",
      value: "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id = ${workflow.input.customerId}"
    }
  ],
  outputs: [
    {
      name: "results",
      destination: "workflow",
      key: "customerData"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Advanced Topics

### Workflow Versioning

Manage changes to workflows over time:

```javascript
// Create a new version of an existing workflow
const newVersion = await client.workflows.createVersion("workflow-123", {
  name: "Content Generation Pipeline v2",
  // Updated workflow definition
});

// List all versions of a workflow
const versions = await client.workflows.listVersions("workflow-123");

// Execute a specific version
const execution = await client.workflows.execute("workflow-123", {
  inputs: { /* ... */ },
  version: 2
});
```

### Workflow Composability

Create reusable sub-workflows:

```javascript
// Define a sub-workflow
const subWorkflow = await client.workflows.create({
  name: "Content Review Process",
  isSubWorkflow: true,
  // Workflow definition
});

// Use the sub-workflow in another workflow
{
  name: "Run Content Review",
  type: "subworkflow",
  workflowId: subWorkflow.id,
  inputs: [
    {
      name: "content",
      source: "workflow",
      key: "generatedContent"
    }
  ],
  outputs: [
    {
      name: "reviewResults",
      destination: "workflow",
      key: "reviewData"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Event-Driven Workflows

Trigger workflows based on events:

```javascript
// Configure an event trigger
await client.workflows.updateTriggers("workflow-123", [
  {
    type: "event",
    eventType: "document.created",
    filter: {
      documentType: "contract"
    }
  }
]);

// Emit an event that will trigger the workflow
await client.events.emit({
  type: "document.created",
  payload: {
    documentId: "doc-456",
    documentType: "contract",
    content: "..."
  }
});
```
