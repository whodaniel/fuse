# VS Code Extension Project Structure Update - May 15, 2025

The following documentation has been updated to reflect the refactored project structure:

1. Added new section in VSCODE-EXTENSION.md with project structure details
2. Created a new DEVELOPMENT-LOG.md file with details of the refactoring
3. Updated the CHANGELOG.md to include refactoring information
4. Updated src/vscode-extension/README.md with current project structure
5. Updated src/vscode-extension/src/commands/README.md with refactoring guidance
6. Created src/vscode-extension/src/utils/README.md explaining utility consolidation
7. Created src/vscode-extension/src/services/README.md for service documentation
8. Created src/vscode-extension/src/views/README.md for WebView documentation
9. Added Migration Guide section to VSCODE-EXTENSION.md

These updates document how the project structure has been refactored, with utilities previously in separate files now integrated directly into relevant service and component classes.

Key files to review:
- DEVELOPMENT-LOG.md - Complete details of the refactoring
- VSCODE-EXTENSION.md - Updated project structure and migration guide
- src/vscode-extension/src/utils/README.md - Utility consolidation details
