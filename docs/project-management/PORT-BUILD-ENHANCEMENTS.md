# Port Management and Build Process Enhancements

## Overview
This PR introduces enhanced port management and build process improvements to resolve port conflicts and streamline development workflow.

## Key Changes

### Port Management
- Automated port clearing before development (`yarn dev`) and building (`yarn build`)
- Standardized port assignments across development and Docker environments
- Added Docker port conflict detection and resolution

### Build Process
- Added pre-build hook for port clearing
- Created optimized production build workflow
- Enhanced Docker build process with proper health checks
- Aligned Docker ports with development environment

### Development Workflow
- VS Code tasks for easy port management
- Automated testing of build workflow
- Documentation improvements

## Port Assignments

| Service | Development | Docker | Production |
|---------|------------|--------|------------|
| Frontend | 3000 | 3000 | 3000 |
| API | 3003 | 3003 | 3003 |
| Backend | 3004 | 3004 | 3004 |
| Reserved | 3001, 3002 | 3001, 3002 | 3001, 3002 |

## New Commands

```bash
# Clear ports manually
yarn kill-ports

# Check Docker port availability
yarn check:docker-ports

# Production build with port clearing
yarn build:production

# Full production pipeline
bash ./scripts/production-build.sh
```

## Testing
- Run `bash ./scripts/test-build-workflow.sh` to verify port management and build workflow
