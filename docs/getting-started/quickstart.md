# The New Fuse - Quick Start Guide

## Getting Started with The New Fuse in VS Code

### Running the Extension

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project root directory:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/danielgoldberg/Desktop/A1-Inter-LLM-Com/The\ New\ Fuse
   ```

2. Run the start script to launch VS Code with the extension:
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

   If the script isn't executable, make it so first:
   ```bash
   chmod +x start.sh
   ```

### Accessing Commands in VS Code

   - macOS: `Cmd+Shift+P` (âŒ˜â‡§P)
   - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+P`

2. Type "The New Fuse" to see all available commands from the extension.
