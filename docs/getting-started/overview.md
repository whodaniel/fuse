# Getting Started with The New Fuse Cleanup

This guide will help you begin the cleanup process immediately using the framework we've established.

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Initialize the Cleanup Environment

```bash
# Run the initialization script to set up everything
node scripts/init-cleanup.js

# This will:
# - Create necessary directories
# - Generate initial reports
# - Create working copies of tracking documents
# - Set up git branch and tag
```

### 2. Review Initial Analysis Reports

```bash
# Review the analysis results
cat reports/cleanup-results.txt

# Check dependency report
cat reports/dependencies-report.json

# Review git contribution stats
cat reports/git-stats.txt
```

### 3. Start with Quick Wins

Begin with tasks that provide immediate value with minimal risk:

1. **Remove unused imports**
   ```bash
   # Run the script to identify unused imports
   node scripts/final-cleanup.js
   
   # Review unused-imports.txt and make necessary changes
   ```

2. **Update critical documentation**
   - Review main README.md for accuracy
   - Update installation instructions
   - Verify API documentation

3. **Standardize folder structure**
   - Start with one module at a time
   - Move files to their proper locations
   - Update imports as needed

## Tracking Progress

As you complete tasks in the cleanup plan:

1. Update the working copy of the cleanup plan:
   ```bash
   # Mark tasks as completed in cleanup-plan-working.md
   # Use [x] for completed tasks
   # Use [~] for in-progress tasks
   ```

2. Update the dashboard:
   ```bash
   # Run the progress update script
   node scripts/update-progress.js
   ```

## First Week Focus Areas

### Day 1-2: Analysis and Planning
- Complete the initial analysis
- Create specific task list based on findings
- Set up tracking mechanisms

### Day 3-4: Documentation and Structure
- Update documentation
- Standardize folder structure
- Create architectural diagrams

### Day 5: Begin Code Consolidation
- Start with one utility category
- Create shared implementations
- Update references

## Collaboration

If working with a team:
1. Assign specific sections to team members
2. Schedule daily check-ins (15 minutes)
3. Use pull requests for significant changes
4. Document decisions and rationales

## Need Help?

If you encounter issues or need guidance:
1. Review the detailed guides in the `docs/` directory
2. Reference the execution plan in `CLEANUP-EXECUTION.md`
3. Consider creating additional analysis scripts for specific problems

## Emergency Rollback

If something goes wrong:
1. Backup files are stored in `cleanup-backups/`
2. Use `git reset --hard pre-cleanup` to revert to pre-cleanup state
3. Refer to the rollback plan in `CLEANUP-EXECUTION.md`
