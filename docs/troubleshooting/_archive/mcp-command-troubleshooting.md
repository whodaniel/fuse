# MCP Command Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps you resolve issues with MCP commands in The New Fuse extension.

## Common Command Issues

### "Command not found" Errors

If you see errors like `command 'thefuse.mcp.showTools' not found`, try these solutions:

1. **Register the Commands**:
   ```bash
   node /Users/danielgoldberg/Desktop/A1-Inter-LLM-Com/The\ New\ Fuse/scripts/initialize-mcp-commands.js
   ```

2. **Restart VS Code**:
   Sometimes VS Code needs to be restarted to recognize newly registered commands.

3. **Check Extension Activation**:
   Ensure The New Fuse extension is properly activated. Check the Output panel for any activation errors.

### Command Registration Issues

The MCP commands are registered during extension activation in `extension.js`. If the commands aren't properly registered:

1. **Check the extension initialization**:
   The extension should initialize the MCP integration with:
   ```javascript
   const mcpIntegration = new mcp_integration_1.MCPIntegration(context);
   await mcpIntegration.initialize();
   mcp_integration_1.registerMCPCommands(context, mcpIntegration);
   ```

2. **Verify import paths**:
   Make sure the import paths are correct:
   ```javascript
   const mcp_integration_1 = require("./src/mcp-integration");
   ```

3. **Manually register commands**:
   You can manually register commands using the script provided.

## MCP Command List

Here are all the MCP-related commands that should be available:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `thefuse.mcp.showTools` | Shows available MCP tools |
| `thefuse.mcp.testTool` | Tests a specific MCP tool |
| `thefuse.mcp.browseMarketplace` | Opens the MCP marketplace |
| `thefuse.mcp.addServer` | Adds a new MCP server |
| `thefuse.mcp.askAgent` | Asks an agent using MCP tools |

## Debugging VSCode Commands

To see what commands are registered in VS Code:

1. Open the command palette (Cmd+Shift+P)
2. Type "Developer: Show Running Commands"

This will show all currently registered commands and can help diagnose if MCP commands are properly registered.

## Manual Command Registration

If automatic registration fails, you can manually register commands in the Developer Console:

1. Open the Developer Console (Help > Toggle Developer Tools)
2. In the Console tab, run:
   ```javascript
   vscode.commands.registerCommand('thefuse.mcp.showTools', () => {
     vscode.window.showInformationMessage('MCP tools command executed');
   });
   ```

## Extension Development

If you're developing the extension:

1. Use the "Launch Extension" VS Code task
2. Check the Debug Console for registration errors
3. Verify the extension activation events in `package.json`

## Last Resort Solution

If all else fails, you can create simple shell scripts that perform the desired actions and bind them to tasks instead of commands:

```json
{
  "label": "Show MCP Tools Alternate",
  "type": "shell",
  "command": "node ${workspaceFolder}/scripts/show-mcp-tools.js",
  "presentation": {
    "reveal": "always",
    "panel": "new",
    "focus": true
  }
}
```
