# MCP Complete Troubleshooting Guide

This comprehensive guide provides detailed steps to diagnose and fix common issues with MCP (Model Context Protocol) in The New Fuse.

## New Diagnostics Tools

We've added several new diagnostic tools to help troubleshoot MCP issues:

1. **MCP Health Check**: Checks the health of all MCP servers
   - Run with: `node scripts/mcp-health-check.js`
   - Detects port conflicts
   - Verifies command availability
   - Tests server connectivity
   - Provides recommendations for fixes

2. **MCP Tools Viewer**: Shows all configured MCP tools
   - Run with: `node scripts/show-mcp-tools.js`
   - Lists servers and their configurations
   - Analyzes configuration for issues
   - Identifies mismatches between server sections

3. **MCP Test Script**: Interactive script to test individual MCP tools
   - Run with: `bash scripts/test-mcp-tools.sh`
   - Tests filesystem operations
   - Tests shell commands
   - Provides a menu-driven interface

4. **Command Registration Script**: Registers MCP commands in VS Code
   - Run with: `node scripts/initialize-mcp-commands.js`
   - Registers VS Code commands
   - Fixes "command not found" errors

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Command Not Found Errors

**Symptoms:**
- "Command 'thefuse.mcp.showTools' not found" messages
- MCP commands don't work in the command palette

**Solutions:**

1. **Register the Commands**:
   ```bash
   node /Users/danielgoldberg/Desktop/A1-Inter-LLM-Com/The\ New\ Fuse/scripts/initialize-mcp-commands.js
   ```

2. **Restart VS Code**:
   Sometimes VS Code needs to be restarted to recognize newly registered commands.

3. **Check Extension Activation**:
   Ensure The New Fuse extension is properly activated. Check the Output panel for any activation errors.

4. **Verify Command Registration**:
   The MCP commands are registered during extension activation in `extension.js`. If the commands aren't properly registered:
   ```javascript
   const mcpIntegration = new mcp_integration_1.MCPIntegration(context);
   await mcpIntegration.initialize();
   mcp_integration_1.registerMCPCommands(context, mcpIntegration);
   ```

5. **Check Import Paths**:
   Make sure the import paths are correct:
   ```javascript
   const mcp_integration_1 = require("./src/mcp-integration");
   ```

### 2. Port Conflicts

**Symptoms:**
- Multiple servers configured to use the same port
- Only one server works at a time
- Error messages about address already in use

**Solutions:**
1. Run MCP Health Check to identify conflicts
2. Edit `mcp_config.json` and change conflicting ports
3. Use different port ranges for different service types
4. Verify changes by running the health check again

### 3. Server Connection Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Cannot connect to MCP servers
- Timeout errors
- Connection refused errors

**Solutions:**
1. Verify server is running with health check
2. Check for port conflicts
3. Ensure required commands are installed
4. Check environment variables in configuration
5. Look for error messages in logs

### 4. Configuration Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Missing servers in tools list
- Duplicate server entries
- Inconsistent server naming

**Solutions:**
1. Run MCP Tools Viewer to analyze configuration
2. Fix duplicate entries in `mcp_config.json`
3. Ensure server names are consistent between sections
4. Use the naming pattern: base name in `servers`, base name + suffix in `mcpServers`

## MCP Command Reference

Here are all the MCP-related commands that should be available:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `thefuse.mcp.showTools` | Shows available MCP tools |
| `thefuse.mcp.testTool` | Tests a specific MCP tool |
| `thefuse.mcp.browseMarketplace` | Opens the MCP marketplace |
| `thefuse.mcp.addServer` | Adds a new MCP server |
| `thefuse.mcp.askAgent` | Asks an agent using MCP tools |

## Debugging Commands

### Check Registered Commands
To see what commands are registered in VS Code:

1. Open the command palette (Cmd+Shift+P)
2. Type "Developer: Show Running Commands"

This will show all currently registered commands and can help diagnose if MCP commands are properly registered.

### Manual Command Registration
If automatic registration fails, you can manually register commands in the Developer Console:

1. Open the Developer Console (Help > Toggle Developer Tools)
2. In the Console tab, run:
   ```javascript
   vscode.commands.registerCommand('thefuse.mcp.showTools', () => {
     vscode.window.showInformationMessage('MCP tools command executed');
   });
   ```

## VS Code Tasks

These tasks are available in the VS Code command palette (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P, then "Tasks: Run Task"):

- **Register MCP Commands**: Register MCP commands in VS Code
- **Show MCP Tools Direct**: Show available MCP tools
- **Run MCP Health Check**: Check the health of all MCP servers
- **MCP Complete Setup**: Run the complete MCP setup process

## Extension Development

If you're developing the extension:

1. Use the "Launch Extension" VS Code task
2. Check the Debug Console for registration errors
3. Verify the extension activation events in `package.json`

## Alternative Solutions

### Shell Scripts as Tasks
If command registration continues to fail, you can create simple shell scripts that perform the desired actions and bind them to tasks instead of commands:

```json
{
  "label": "Show MCP Tools Alternate",
  "type": "shell",
  "command": "node ${workspaceFolder}/scripts/show-mcp-tools.js",
  "presentation": {
    "reveal": "always",
    "panel": "new",
    "focus": true
  }
}
```

## Fixes Made

1. Fixed port conflict between `the-new-fuse-mcp` and `the-new-fuse-mcp-server`
2. Added diagnostic tools for MCP troubleshooting
3. Created command registration script
4. Added VS Code tasks for direct access to MCP tools
5. Updated documentation with detailed troubleshooting steps

## Next Steps

If you continue to encounter issues with MCP:

1. Check the logs in `./mcp/logs/mcp-server.log`
2. Run the health check for detailed diagnostics
3. Try using direct script versions of tools
4. Update configuration to resolve conflicts
5. Restart VS Code after making changes
6. Consider using alternative task-based solutions for critical functionality
