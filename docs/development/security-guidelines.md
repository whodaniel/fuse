# Security Implementation Guidelines

## Secure Development Practices

### Secure Coding Standards
- Input validation patterns
- Output encoding requirements
- Error handling best practices
- Secure dependency management

### Code Review Process
- Mandatory security review for:
  - Authentication flows
  - Data encryption implementations
  - Permission checks
  - API endpoints
- Automated SAST/DAST integration

## Incident Response

### Reporting Procedures
1. Immediate isolation of compromised systems
2. Forensic evidence preservation
3. Stakeholder notification process
4. Post-mortem analysis requirements

### Breach Notification
- Internal escalation timeline (15 minutes)
- Regulatory compliance timelines

- HIPAA compliance for health data
- PCI-DSS for payment processing
- SOC 2 Type II controls

### Audit Procedures
- Quarterly penetration testing
- Annual third-party audits
- Continuous compliance monitoring

## Security Training

### Developer Onboarding
- Secure coding bootcamp
- Infrastructure security overview
- Incident response training

### Ongoing Education
- Monthly security workshops
- Phishing simulation exercises
- Zero-day vulnerability briefings
