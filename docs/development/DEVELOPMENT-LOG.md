# Development Log - The New Fuse

## May 16, 2025 - TypeScript ESM Configuration Modernization

### Issue Summary
After successfully implementing ESM support in the project, we noticed some experimental warnings when starting the application:

1. Warning about `--experimental-specifier-resolution=node` flag
2. Warning about experimental loaders

These warnings indicate the use of unstable Node.js features that could change in the future.

### Applied Fixes

1. **Updated Node.js execution flags**:
   - Replaced `--loader ts-node/esm` with `--import ts-node/register/esm` (stable API)
   - Removed the `--experimental-specifier-resolution=node` flag
   
2. **Simplified tsconfig.node.json configuration**:
   - Removed `experimentalSpecifierResolution` setting
   - Added explicit module configuration
   
3. **Created tsconfig.paths.json**:
   - For better path alias resolution

4. **Updated documentation**:
   - Created ESM-QUICK-REFERENCE-UPDATED.md
   - Added modernization details to development log

### Results

✅ **Fixed** - Application now runs without experimental warnings while maintaining full ESM compatibility.

### Next Steps
- Test thoroughly to ensure all path resolutions work correctly
- Standardize ESM import patterns across codebase
- Remove the backup files once stability is confirmed

## May 16, 2025 - TypeScript ESM Configuration Fix

### Issue Summary
The project was experiencing TypeScript compilation and runtime errors related to ES Modules (ESM). Specifically:

1. `ERROR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION`: Node.js didn't know how to handle `.ts` files in ESM context
2. `Cannot find module '@/routes/agents'`: Path alias resolution wasn't working with ESM
3. `exports is not defined in ES module scope`: CommonJS syntax was used in ESM files

### Applied Fixes

We implemented a comprehensive fix with the following components:

1. **Updated nodemon configuration files** in both API and backend apps:
   ```json
   {
     "watch": ["src"],
     "ext": "ts",
     "ignore": ["src/**/*.spec.ts"],
     "exec": "node --loader ts-node/esm --experimental-specifier-resolution=node src/index.ts"
   }
   ```

2. **Created ts-node configuration files** (`tsconfig.node.json`) in:
   - Root project directory
   - API app directory
   - Backend app directory

   Sample content:
   ```json
   {
     "extends": "./tsconfig.json",
     "ts-node": {
       "esm": true,
       "experimentalSpecifierResolution": "node"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Converted path aliases** in imports to relative paths with `.js` extensions
   
4. **Created missing directory structure** (src/routes/agents) with placeholder content

5. **Created a comprehensive fix script** (`fix-typescript-esm-all.sh`) that can be used for future similar issues

### Results

✅ **Fixed** - Both API and backend applications now start successfully.

The console output shows:
```
[@the-new-fuse/api-server]: API server running on port 3003
[@the-new-fuse/backend-app]: [Nest] 55704  - 05/16/2025, 1:41:20 PM     LOG [NestApplication] Nest application successfully started +2ms
[@the-new-fuse/backend-app]: Backend API server started on port 3004
```

Some expected experimental warnings are shown but can be safely ignored.

### Documentation

Added comprehensive documentation:
- Updated `docs/TYPESCRIPT_ESM_CONFIGURATION.md` with best practices and troubleshooting tips
- Created this development log entry

### Next Steps

1. Consider updating project dependencies to use stable versions of features currently marked as experimental
2. Standardize ESM usage patterns across the codebase
3. Update developer onboarding documentation with ESM configuration requirements
