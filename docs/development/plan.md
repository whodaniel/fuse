# The New Fuse - Development Plan

## Current Status Assessment

The New Fuse is a framework designed to enable structured communication between different AI agent extensions within VSCode to facilitate collaboration on coding projects. This document provides a comprehensive assessment of the current state and a detailed plan for further development.

## Current Implementation Status

### Core Components
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Partially implemented with basic message structure and capability discovery
- **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol**: Basic implementation with message types and protocol adapters
- **VS Code Extension**: Initial implementation with command registration and UI components
- **Agent Adapters**: Basic adapters for GitHub Copilot and Claude

### Known Issues
- TypeScript errors in various files, particularly in error handling modules
- Inconsistent project structure and organization
- Missing or incomplete documentation
- Build and script issues
- Corrupted files with malformed code

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Stabilization (Current)
- Fix TypeScript errors and syntax issues
- Correct malformed code in error handling modules
- Fix import/export issues
- Ensure consistent typing across the codebase
- Update documentation to provide a single source of truth

### Phase 2: Consolidation
- Organize the codebase according to the intended architecture
- Ensure consistent naming conventions
- Standardize file organization
- Consolidate duplicate functionality
- Implement comprehensive testing

### Phase 3: Feature Completion
- Complete MCP implementation with full capability discovery and execution
- Enhance A2A protocol with improved message routing and error handling
- Expand agent adapters to support more AI systems
- Implement workflow orchestration system
- Add monitoring and analytics

### Phase 4: Performance and Security
- Optimize performance of communication protocols
- Implement security measures for agent interactions
- Add authentication and authorization
- Implement rate limiting and throttling
- Add encryption for sensitive data

### Phase 5: Distribution and Documentation
- Package the framework for easy distribution
- Create comprehensive documentation
- Develop examples and tutorials
- Implement CI/CD pipeline
- Prepare for open-source release

## Task Allocation

### Core Framework
- Complete MCP implementation

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Fix TypeScript errors and syntax issues
2. Correct malformed code in error handling modules
3. Update documentation to provide a single source of truth
4. Organize the codebase according to the intended architecture
5. Implement comprehensive testing

## Long-Term Vision

The long-term vision for The New Fuse is to become the standard framework for AI agent communication and collaboration in software development. By providing a robust, secure, and extensible platform for AI agents to work together, The New Fuse aims to revolutionize how developers interact with AI assistants and how these assistants collaborate with each other.

Key aspects of this vision include:
- **Seamless Integration**: AI agents should be able to work together seamlessly, regardless of their underlying implementation
- **Workflow Automation**: Complex workflows involving multiple AI agents should be easy to define and execute
- **Developer Experience**: The framework should enhance the developer experience by making AI collaboration intuitive and productive
- **Extensibility**: The framework should be easily extensible to support new AI systems and use cases
- **Security and Privacy**: The framework should prioritize security and privacy in all aspects of its design and implementation

## Conclusion

The New Fuse has the potential to significantly enhance how developers work with AI assistants by enabling these assistants to collaborate effectively. By following this development plan, we can realize this potential and create a framework that revolutionizes AI-assisted software development.
