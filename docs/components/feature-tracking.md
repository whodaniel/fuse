# Component Feature Tracking System

## Purpose

This document establishes a systematic approach to track features and functionality across components during the consolidation process. The goal is to ensure that no valuable features are lost when consolidating duplicate components or removing unused ones.

## Feature Tracking Methodology

### 1. Component Feature Inventory

For each component identified for consolidation or review, document the following:

| Feature ID | Feature Description | Implementation Details | Used By | Priority | Migration Status |
|------------|---------------------|------------------------|---------|----------|------------------|
| FID-001    | Feature description | How it's implemented   | List of components/pages | High/Medium/Low | Not Started/In Progress/Completed |

### 2. Feature Comparison Matrix

When consolidating duplicate components, use this matrix to compare features across implementations:

| Feature | Component A | Component B | Component C | Target Implementation |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Feature 1 | ✓ (details) | ✓ (details) | ✗ | Component A approach because... |
| Feature 2 | ✗ | ✓ (details) | ✓ (details) | Component B approach because... |
| Feature 3 | ✓ (details) | ✗ | ✓ (details) | New implementation that combines... |

## Implementation Process

### Step 1: Feature Extraction

For each component:

1. Review the component code to identify all features and functionality
2. Document props, state management, event handlers, and rendering logic
3. Note any unique behaviors or edge cases handled
4. Identify dependencies and integration points

### Step 2: Usage Analysis

1. Identify all places where the component is used
2. Document which features are used in each instance
3. Note any customizations or special configurations

### Step 3: Consolidation Decision

For each feature:

1. Compare implementations across duplicate components
2. Evaluate based on:
   - Code quality and maintainability
   - Performance characteristics
   - Flexibility and reusability
   - Test coverage
   - Documentation
3. Select the best implementation or create a new one that combines strengths

### Step 4: Migration Plan

1. Create a consolidated component with all required features
2. Update all references to use the new component
3. Test thoroughly to ensure all functionality is preserved
4. Document any API changes or migration steps

## Backup Strategy

Before consolidating or removing any component:

1. Create a backup of the original component
2. Document all features and functionality in the tracking system
3. Ensure the backup is stored in the designated backup directory

## Testing Approach

After consolidation:

1. Unit test each feature of the consolidated component
2. Integration test all usage scenarios
3. Verify that all edge cases are handled correctly
4. Perform regression testing on affected areas

## Example: Button Component Consolidation

### Feature Inventory

| Feature ID | Feature Description | Implementation Details | Used By | Priority | Migration Status |
|------------|---------------------|------------------------|---------|----------|------------------|
| BTN-001 | Primary/Secondary/Tertiary variants | Uses different CSS classes | Dashboard, Forms | High | Not Started |
| BTN-002 | Size variations (sm, md, lg) | Uses different CSS classes | Throughout app | High | Not Started |
| BTN-003 | Loading state with spinner | Uses state and conditional rendering | Forms, Data tables | Medium | Not Started |
| BTN-004 | Icon support (left/right) | Accepts icon component as prop | Navigation, Toolbars | Medium | Not Started |
| BTN-005 | Tooltip support | Uses title attribute or custom tooltip | Advanced UI | Low | Not Started |

### Feature Comparison Matrix

| Feature | UI Button | Core Button | Feature Button | Target Implementation |
|---------|-----------|-------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Variants | ✓ (3 variants) | ✓ (5 variants) | ✓ (2 variants) | Core Button - more comprehensive |
| Sizes | ✓ (3 sizes) | ✓ (3 sizes) | ✓ (2 sizes) | UI Button - cleaner implementation |
| Loading | ✓ (spinner) | ✗ | ✓ (text only) | UI Button - better UX |
| Icons | ✓ (limited) | ✓ (flexible) | ✗ | Core Button - more flexible |
| Tooltip | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | Feature Button - better accessibility |

## Conclusion

By systematically tracking features across components, we can ensure that the consolidation process preserves all valuable functionality while eliminating redundancy. This approach minimizes the risk of losing important features and provides a clear path for migration.
