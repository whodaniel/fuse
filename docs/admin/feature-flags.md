# Feature Flags Administration

## Overview

The feature flags system provides a comprehensive way to manage feature rollouts, A/B testing, and conditional feature activation. The system supports various conditions and targeting options, with real-time metrics tracking.

## Key Features

- **Environment-based targeting**: Control feature availability across different environments (development, testing, staging, production)
- **User group targeting**: Enable features for specific user groups or roles
- **Percentage-based rollouts**: Gradually roll out features to a percentage of users
- **Date-based activation**: Schedule feature activation within specific date ranges
- **Device type targeting**: Target specific device types (desktop, mobile, tablet)
- **Custom rule support**: Create custom JavaScript conditions for complex targeting scenarios
- **Real-time metrics**: Track usage, errors, and effectiveness of feature flags

## Managing Feature Flags

### Access

Navigate to Admin Panel > Feature Flags to access the feature flag management interface.

### Creating Feature Flags

1. Click "Create Feature" button
2. Fill in the basic details:
   - Name (required)
   - Description
   - Stage (development/testing/staging/production)
   - Priority (low/medium/high)
3. Configure conditions:
   - Environment restrictions
   - User group targeting
   - Percentage rollout
   - Date range activation
   - Device type targeting
   - Custom rules

### Conditions Configuration

#### Environment Targeting
- Select one or more environments where the feature should be active
- Feature will only be enabled in selected environments

#### User Groups
- Add specific user groups that should have access to the feature
- Users must belong to at least one of the specified groups

#### Percentage Rollout
- Set a percentage of users who should see the feature
- Enable "sticky" option to ensure consistent user experience
- Percentage is calculated based on user ID or session ID

#### Date Range
- Set start and end dates for feature availability
- Timezone support for accurate scheduling
- Feature automatically enables/disables based on schedule

#### Device Types
- Target specific device types (desktop, mobile, tablet)
- Multiple device types can be selected
- Uses User-Agent detection for identification

#### Custom Rules
- Write custom JavaScript conditions
- Access to user context object
- Support for complex business logic

### Metrics and Monitoring

The following metrics are tracked for each feature flag:

- **Usage Count**: Number of times the feature was accessed
- **Errors**: Count of errors occurred while evaluating the feature
- **Exposures**: Number of times the feature was evaluated
- **Positive Evaluations**: Count of times the feature was enabled
- **Last Used**: Timestamp of most recent access

## API Integration

### Endpoints

- `GET /api/admin/features`: List all feature flags
- `POST /api/admin/features`: Create new feature flag
- `GET /api/admin/features/:id`: Get specific feature flag
- `PATCH /api/admin/features/:id`: Update feature flag
- `DELETE /api/admin/features/:id`: Delete feature flag

### Response Format

```typescript
interface FeatureFlag {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  enabled: boolean;
  stage: 'development' | 'testing' | 'staging' | 'production';
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  conditions: {
    environments?: string[];
    userGroups?: Array<{
      groupId: string;
      name: string;
      description?: string;
    }>;
    percentage?: {
      value: number;
      sticky: boolean;
    };
    dateRange?: {
      startDate?: Date;
      endDate?: Date;
      timezone?: string;
    };
    deviceTypes?: Array<'desktop' | 'mobile' | 'tablet'>;
    customRules?: Array<{
      name: string;
      condition: string;
    }>;
  };
  metadata: {
    createdBy: string;
    createdAt: Date;
    lastModifiedBy: string;
    lastModifiedAt: Date;
    metrics: {
      usageCount: number;
      lastUsed?: Date;
      errors: number;
      exposures: number;
      positiveEvaluations: number;
    };
  };
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Naming Conventions**
   - Use clear, descriptive names
   - Follow format: `[feature-area]_[feature-name]`
   - Example: `auth_mfa_enabled`

2. **Documentation**
   - Provide clear descriptions
   - Document expected behavior
   - Note dependencies and requirements

3. **Testing**
   - Test feature with all condition combinations
   - Verify metrics tracking
   - Test performance impact

4. **Cleanup**
   - Remove flags for fully launched features
   - Archive rather than delete for historical data
   - Regular review of unused flags

5. **Security**
   - Restrict admin access
   - Review custom rules for security implications
   - Monitor for unusual patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Feature not appearing in environment**
   - Check environment targeting
   - Verify user group membership
   - Check custom rule syntax

2. **Inconsistent behavior**
   - Check sticky settings for percentage rollouts
   - Verify date range timezone settings
   - Review custom rule logic

3. **Performance issues**
   - Monitor custom rule complexity
   - Check database indexes
   - Review caching strategy

### Monitoring

- Monitor error rates in metrics
- Track usage patterns
- Set up alerts for unusual behavior
