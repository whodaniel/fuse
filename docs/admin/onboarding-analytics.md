# Onboarding Analytics Guide

This guide explains how to use the onboarding analytics features in The New Fuse platform's Admin Control Panel.

## Overview

The onboarding analytics dashboard provides insights into how users are experiencing your onboarding process. You can track completion rates, identify drop-off points, and understand user behavior to optimize the onboarding experience.

## Accessing Onboarding Analytics

1. Log in to The New Fuse platform with an administrator account
2. Navigate to the Admin Control Panel
3. Click on "Onboarding" in the sidebar navigation
4. Select the "Wizard Preview" tab
5. Click on the "Analytics" sub-tab

## Available Metrics

### Completion Metrics

- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of users who complete the entire onboarding process
- **Total Onboardings Started**: Number of users who began onboarding
- **Completed Onboardings**: Number of users who finished onboarding
- **Average Completion Time**: Average time users spend completing onboarding

### User Engagement

- **Average Time per Step**: How long users spend on each step
- **Step Interaction Rate**: Percentage of users who interact with optional elements
- **Feedback Scores**: User ratings of the onboarding experience (if feedback collection is enabled)

### Drop-off Analysis

- **Drop-off Points**: Steps where users abandon the onboarding process
- **Drop-off Rates**: Percentage of users who drop off at each step
- **Abandonment Reasons**: Common reasons for abandonment (if collected)

### User Segmentation

## Using Analytics to Improve Onboarding

### Identifying Problem Areas

1. Look for steps with high drop-off rates
2. Analyze time spent on each step (unusually long times may indicate confusion)
3. Compare completion rates across different user types
4. Review user feedback for specific pain points

### Making Data-Driven Improvements

1. Simplify steps with high drop-off rates
2. Add clearer instructions to steps where users spend a long time
3. Customize the experience for user types with low completion rates
4. A/B test different versions of problematic steps

### Tracking Improvement Over Time

1. Set baseline metrics before making changes
2. Implement changes one at a time to isolate their effects
3. Monitor metrics after each change
4. Compare metrics across different time periods

## Exporting Analytics Data

1. Click the "Export" button in the analytics dashboard
2. Select the date range for the data
3. Choose the export format (CSV, Excel, or JSON)
4. Click "Download" to save the file

## Setting Up Analytics Alerts

1. Click the "Alerts" button in the analytics dashboard
2. Click "Add Alert"
3. Select the metric to monitor
4. Set the threshold for the alert
5. Choose the notification method (email, Slack, etc.)
6. Click "Save Alert"

## Privacy Considerations

- All analytics data is anonymized by default
- No personally identifiable information is collected
- Users can opt out of analytics collection
- Data retention policies comply with GDPR and other privacy regulations

## Troubleshooting

- **No data showing**: Ensure analytics collection is enabled in General Settings
- **Incomplete data**: Check that all steps have analytics tracking enabled
- **Discrepancies in metrics**: Verify that all users are being tracked correctly
- **Export failures**: Try a smaller date range or different export format
