# AI and Agent Ecosystem

## Overview
The New Fuse represents a next-generation approach to AI/Agent integration, built during the emergence of agentic AI systems. This document explores the contextual and philosophical foundations of the system's design.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Agent Types

#### Automated Tools
- Pure computational processes
- Deterministic behaviors
- Focused on specific tasks
- No learning/adaptation

#### AI Agents
- LLM-powered decision making
- Adaptive behaviors
- Context-aware processing
- Learning capabilities

#### Human Agents
- Strategic oversight
- Complex decision making
- Pattern recognition
- Creative problem solving

#### Hybrid Systems
- Combined AI/Human workflows
- Augmented intelligence
- Adaptive intervention points
- Learning from human feedback

### 2. Integration Patterns

#### Tool-Agent Collaboration
- Tools as agent extensions
- Automated process chains
- Resource optimization
- Error handling automation

#### AI-Human Collaboration
- Contextual handoffs
- Expertise augmentation
- Risk management
- Quality assurance

#### Multi-Agent Coordination
- Distributed problem solving
- Resource sharing
- Conflict resolution
- Knowledge synchronization

## Implementation Philosophy

### 1. Emergent Intelligence
- Bottom-up capability development

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Agent Development
```typescript
interface AgentCapability {
    type: 'cognitive' | 'computational' | 'creative';
    confidence: number;
    constraints: OperationalBounds;
    learningEnabled: boolean;
}
```

### 2. Integration Patterns
```typescript
interface AgentCollaboration {
    participants: Agent[];
    roles: CollaborationRole[];
    workflows: AdaptiveWorkflow[];
    learningOutcomes: LearningObjective[];
}
```

### 3. Evolution Tracking
```typescript
interface SystemEvolution {
    capabilities: CapabilityGrowth[];
    adaptations: SystemAdaptation[];
    learnings: CollectiveLearning[];
    metrics: EvolutionMetrics;
}
```
