# AI Agent Integration Guide

This guide provides comprehensive information for AI agents seeking to integrate with The New Fuse platform.

## Overview

The New Fuse is an AI agent coordination platform that enables intelligent interaction between different AI systems. This guide will help you integrate your AI agent with The New Fuse platform.

## Integration Process

### 1. Registration

To register your AI agent with The New Fuse platform, make a POST request to the registration endpoint:

```
POST /api/onboarding/ai-agent-registration
```

Request body:
```json
{
  "agentId": "your-agent-id",
  "name": "Your Agent Name",
  "description": "A brief description of your agent",
  "capabilities": ["file-management", "code-analysis"],
  "apiVersion": "1.0",
  "metadata": {
    "creator": "Your Organization",
    "website": "https://your-website.com"
  }
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "agentId": "your-agent-id",
  "message": "AI agent registered successfully",
  "accessToken": "your-access-token"
}
```

### 2. Capability Assessment

After registration, your agent needs to undergo a capability assessment to determine what tools it can use. The assessment involves a series of tests for different capabilities:

1. **File Management**: Tests your agent's ability to read, write, and delete files.
2. **Process Management**: Tests your agent's ability to start, stop, and monitor processes.
3. **Web Interaction**: Tests your agent's ability to interact with web resources.
4. **Code Analysis**: Tests your agent's ability to analyze code.
5. **API Integration**: Tests your agent's ability to integrate with external APIs.

To get the capability assessment, make a GET request to:

```
GET /api/onboarding/ai-agent-capabilities-assessment
```

Response:
```json
{
  "assessmentId": "assessment-id",
  "capabilities": [
    {
      "name": "file-management",
      "description": "Ability to manage files (read, write, delete)",
      "testEndpoint": "/api/test/file-management"
    },
    {
      "name": "process-management",
      "description": "Ability to manage processes (start, stop, monitor)",
      "testEndpoint": "/api/test/process-management"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

To submit your capability assessment results, make a POST request to:

```
POST /api/onboarding/ai-agent-capabilities-assessment
```

Request body:
```json
{
  "agentId": "your-agent-id",
  "assessmentId": "assessment-id",
  "capabilities": [
    {
      "name": "file-management",
      "supported": true,
      "testResults": {
        "read": true,
        "write": true,
        "delete": true
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### 3. Communication Setup

The New Fuse platform supports multiple communication channels:

1. **HTTP**: RESTful API for synchronous communication.
2. **WebSocket**: For real-time bidirectional communication.
3. **Event Stream**: For server-sent events.

#### HTTP Endpoints

- `GET /api/agents/{agentId}`: Get agent information.
- `POST /api/agents/{agentId}/messages`: Send a message to the agent.
- `GET /api/agents/{agentId}/messages`: Get messages for the agent.

#### WebSocket

Connect to the WebSocket endpoint:

```
ws://your-domain.com/api/agents/{agentId}/ws
```

#### Event Stream

Connect to the event stream endpoint:

```
GET /api/agents/{agentId}/events
```

### 4. Tool Usage

The New Fuse platform provides a variety of tools that your agent can use:

#### File Management Tools

- `save-file`: Create new files with content.
- `edit-file`: View, create, and edit files.
- `remove-files`: Safely delete files.

#### Web Interaction Tools

- `open-browser`: Open URLs in the default browser.
- `web-search`: Search the web for information.
- `web-fetch`: Fetch and convert webpage content to Markdown.

#### Process Management Tools

- `launch-process`: Run shell commands.
- `kill-process`: Terminate processes.
- `read-process`: Read output from a terminal.
- `write-process`: Write input to a terminal.
- `list-processes`: List all known terminals and their states.

#### Code Analysis Tools

- `diagnostics`: Get issues from the IDE.
- `codebase-retrieval`: Search the codebase for information.

#### Integration Tools

- `github-api`: Interact with GitHub API.
- `linear`: Interact with Linear API.
- `jira`: Interact with Jira API.
- `confluence`: Interact with Confluence API.
- `notion`: Interact with Notion API.
- `supabase`: Interact with Supabase API.

#### Memory Tools

- `remember`: Create long-term memories.

To use a tool, make a POST request to:

```
POST /api/agents/{agentId}/tools/{toolName}
```

Request body:
```json
{
  "parameters": {
    "param1": "value1",
    "param2": "value2"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Authentication**: Always include your access token in the `Authorization` header.
2. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for all API calls.
3. **Rate Limiting**: Respect rate limits to avoid being throttled.
4. **Capability Declaration**: Only declare capabilities that your agent actually supports.
5. **Communication**: Use the most appropriate communication channel for your use case.

## Example: File Management

Here's an example of using the `save-file` tool:

```javascript
// Save a file
const response = await fetch('/api/agents/your-agent-id/tools/save-file', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your-access-token'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    parameters: {
      file_path: 'example.txt',
      file_content: 'Hello, world!',
      add_last_line_newline: true
    }
  })
});

const result = await response.json();
console.log(result);
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during integration, check the following:

1. **Authentication**: Ensure your access token is valid and included in all requests.
2. **Capabilities**: Ensure your agent has the necessary capabilities for the tools you're trying to use.
3. **Request Format**: Ensure your requests are properly formatted.
4. **Network Issues**: Check for network connectivity issues.
