### MCP Server Configuration Standardization

**Description:**
Standardized MCP server configurations across the project by adding all MCP servers from the Claude desktop configuration to the project's MCP configuration files. This ensures consistent MCP server availability across different components of the system.

**Changes:**

- Added the following MCP servers to all configuration files:
  - `context7-server`: Node server for Context7 integration
  - `applescript_execute`: AppleScript MCP server for macOS automation
  - `mcp-config-manager`: Configuration management server
  - `browsermcp`: Browser MCP integration server
  - `MCP_DOCKER`: Docker-based MCP server using Alpine/socat

**Updated Files:**

- `mcp_config.json`: Main project MCP configuration
- `src/vscode-extension/mcp_config.json`: VS Code extension MCP configuration
- `data/mcp_config.json`: Data directory MCP configuration

**Benefits:**

1. Improved interoperability between different components of the system
2. Consistent MCP server availability across all parts of the application
3. Better integration with Claude desktop and other AI assistants
4. Enhanced capability for cross-platform and cross-environment communication

**Future Improvements:**

- Implement automatic MCP server discovery and configuration synchronization
- Create a unified MCP server management interface
- Add health monitoring for MCP servers

### VS Code Extension Project Structure Refactoring

**Description:**
The VS Code extension project structure has been refactored to improve organization, maintainability, and clarity. This refactoring consolidates utility functions directly into service and component classes rather than having them in separate utility files.

**Changes:**

- Reorganized file structure to better reflect component responsibilities
- Consolidated utility functions directly into service and component classes
- Removed separate utility files in favor of integrated functionality:
  - `fs-utils.ts/js`: File system utilities now integrated directly using Node's `fs/promises` in relevant services
  - `webview-utils.ts/js`: WebView functionality integrated into individual view providers
  - `uri-utils.ts/js`: URI handling now done directly using VS Code's `vscode.Uri` methods
  - `vscode-utils.ts/js`: VS Code-specific utilities integrated into respective components
  - `index.ts/js` files: Barrel exports removed in favor of direct imports
  - `panel-utils.ts/js`: Panel utility functions integrated directly into each panel provider class
  - `debug-panel-provider.ts/js` and `logger-panel-provider.ts/js`: Functionality consolidated elsewhere

**Current Directory Structure:**

├── monitoring/          # Monitoring and telemetry
└── types/               # TypeScript type definitions
```

**Benefits:**

1. Improved code organization and clarity
2. Reduced file count and project complexity
3. Better cohesion between related functionality
4. More intuitive component relationships
5. Easier navigation and maintenance of the codebase

**Documentation Updates:**

- Added project structure section to VSCODE-EXTENSION.md
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with refactoring details

**Affected Components:**

- All components that previously used separate utility files now handle that functionality directly

**Future Improvements:**

- Further standardize the approach to utility functions
- Consider creating a centralized utilities registry for commonly used functions if needed
- Implement proper TypeScript path aliases to improve import readability
