# The New Fuse - Final Cleanup and Consolidation Plan

## Project Structure Improvements
- [ ] Standardize folder structure across the project
  - [ ] Ensure consistent package organization (components, utils, hooks, etc.)
  - [ ] Standardize file locations for tests, types, and styles
  - [ ] Apply consistent naming patterns for directories
- [ ] Ensure proper separation of concerns (UI, logic, state management)
  - [ ] Extract business logic from UI components into separate files
  - [ ] Move reusable state logic to custom hooks
  - [ ] Separate API communication layer from components
- [ ] Organize shared utilities and components consistently
  - [ ] Create a unified utilities directory structure
  - [ ] Establish clear boundaries between core and feature-specific components
  - [ ] Implement proper barrel files (index.ts) for clean exports

## Code Redundancy Elimination
- [ ] Identify and consolidate duplicate utility functions
  - [ ] Create shared formatting functions
  - [ ] Standardize error handling utilities
  - [ ] Merge similar data processing functions
- [ ] Standardize shared interfaces and types
  - [ ] Create consistent type naming conventions
  - [ ] Move common types to dedicated shared type files
  - [ ] Eliminate duplicate type definitions
- [ ] Merge similar components with parameterized differences
  - [ ] Identify component pairs with similar functionality
  - [ ] Create configurable versions to replace duplicates
  - [ ] Implement proper prop interfaces for consolidated components

## Documentation Updates
- [ ] Ensure all modules have proper JSDoc/TSDoc comments
  - [ ] Document all public functions and interfaces
  - [ ] Add return type annotations where missing
  - [ ] Include parameter descriptions for all functions
- [ ] Update README files to reflect current architecture
  - [ ] Standardize README format across projects
  - [ ] Include usage examples in component READMEs
  - [ ] Document any breaking changes from consolidation
- [ ] Create/update architecture diagrams
  - [ ] Create high-level system architecture diagram
  - [ ] Document component relationships
  - [ ] Create data flow diagrams for key processes
- [ ] Verify API documentation matches implementation
  - [ ] Update endpoint documentation
  - [ ] Validate request/response examples
  - [ ] Document any API changes from consolidation

## Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Remove unused imports
  - [ ] Eliminate dead imports from all files
  - [ ] Replace large library imports with specific functions
  - [ ] Audit and clean up CSS imports
- [ ] Implement code splitting where beneficial
  - [ ] Add lazy loading for complex route components
  - [ ] Split large components into smaller chunks
  - [ ] Use dynamic imports for less frequently used features
- [ ] Optimize bundle size through tree shaking
  - [ ] Update package.json with proper sideEffects configuration
  - [ ] Convert CommonJS modules to ES modules
  - [ ] Implement proper export patterns for tree-shaking

## Testing Coverage
- [ ] Ensure critical paths have adequate test coverage
  - [ ] Add tests for core business logic
  - [ ] Test edge cases in data processing functions
  - [ ] Verify error handling scenarios
- [ ] Update tests to match current implementation
  - [ ] Fix broken tests from consolidation changes
  - [ ] Ensure test coverage for refactored components
  - [ ] Add integration tests for key workflows
- [ ] Fix any broken tests
  - [ ] Update outdated assertions
  - [ ] Fix test environment issues
  - [ ] Eliminate flaky tests

## Dependency Management
- [ ] Review and update dependencies
  - [ ] Update packages to latest stable versions
  - [ ] Address security vulnerabilities
  - [ ] Test application with updated dependencies
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies
  - [ ] Audit package.json for unused packages
  - [ ] Remove transitive dependencies that are no longer needed
  - [ ] Clean up devDependencies
- [ ] Consolidate similar dependencies
  - [ ] Standardize on a single state management solution
  - [ ] Use consistent UI component libraries
  - [ ] Eliminate overlapping utility libraries

## Final Verification Checklist
- [ ] Build succeeds without warnings
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Documentation is accurate
- [ ] No unused code remains
- [ ] No console.log statements in production code
- [ ] Code style is consistent
- [ ] Bundle size is optimized
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet targets
- [ ] Accessibility requirements are met
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility is verified
