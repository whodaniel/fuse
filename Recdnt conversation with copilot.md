I'll help you check and use the initialized MCP tools. Here's a guide to work with the tools:

Working with MCP Tools After Initialization
Now that MCP has been initialized with 3 test tools, you can:

1. View Available Tools
Open the Command Palette: Cmd+Shift+P (macOS) or Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux)
Type "Show MCP Tools" and select it
You'll see a dropdown with the 3 available tools:
list_files - Lists files in a directory
read_file - Reads file contents
brave_search - Searches the web
2. Test a Tool Directly
Open the Command Palette: Cmd+Shift+P
Type "Test MCP Tool" and select it
Select one of the tools from the dropdown (e.g., list_files)
When prompted for parameters, enter JSON for the tool:
For list_files, try: {"path": "./data"}
For read_file, try: {"path": "./data/example.txt"}
For brave_search, try: {"query": "TypeScript MCP tools"}
A document will open with the results of your tool execution
3. Ask the AI Agent to Use Tools
Open the Command Palette: Cmd+Shift+P
Type "Ask Agent with MCP Tools" and select it
Enter a question like:
"List all files in the data directory"
"Show me the content of example.txt"
"Search for information about MCP tools"
The agent will determine which tool to use and show you the result
4. Create Sample Files to Work With
Let's create a sample file to test with. Run this in your terminal:

Or use VS Code to create a file at that location.

5. Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:

Make sure you're running the commands through the Command Palette
Try initializing MCP again using the "Initialize MCP Integration" command
Check the Output panel in VS Code (View > Output) for any error messages
Make sure the extension is properly loaded (you should see the MCP icon in the status bar)
The next steps are to experiment with the MCP tools, test their capabilities, and explore how the agent uses them to answer your queries!
