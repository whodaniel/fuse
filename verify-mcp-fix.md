# MCP Config Manager Fix Verification

## Issue Resolution Summary
The "mcp-config-manager" server was showing as "failed" with "Server disconnected" error in Claude Desktop due to a **protocol version mismatch**.

## What Was Fixed
1. **Protocol Compatibility**: Updated the MCP server to support both old and new MCP protocol formats
2. **Method Support**: Added modern MCP methods (`tools/list`, `tools/call`, `initialized`) alongside legacy methods
3. **Response Format**: Updated response format to match modern MCP protocol specification (protocol version "2024-11-05")
4. **Syntax Errors**: Fixed duplicate code and syntax issues that were preventing the server from starting

## Verification Steps
1. ✅ **Syntax Check**: Server script now has correct syntax (no more SyntaxError)
2. ✅ **Protocol Test**: Server responds correctly to modern MCP protocol requests
3. ✅ **Tool Availability**: All three tools are properly exposed:
   - `list_mcp_servers` - List registered MCP servers
   - `add_mcp_server` - Add or update MCP server configurations  
   - `remove_mcp_server` - Remove MCP server configurations
4. ✅ **Process Running**: Server is now running as process in Claude Desktop (PID 63804)

## How to Test in Claude Desktop
1. Open Claude Desktop
2. The "mcp-config-manager" server should now show as "connected" instead of "failed"
3. You should be able to ask Claude to:
   - "List my MCP servers"
   - "Add a new MCP server" 
   - "Remove an MCP server"

## Technical Changes Made
- Updated `handleInitialize()` to return modern protocol version and capabilities
- Added `handleToolsList()` function with proper `inputSchema` format
- Added support for `tools/list` and `tools/call` methods
- Added `initialized` method handler
- Fixed syntax errors and removed duplicate code

The MCP server should now work correctly with Claude Desktop's current protocol implementation.
