# The New Fuse - Project Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the roadmap for The New Fuse project, including current status, planned features, and future directions.

## Current Status (Q2 2023)

The New Fuse is currently in active development with the following components:

- **Core Framework**: The foundation of the system, including the MCP and A2A protocols
- **VS Code Extension**: Integration with VS Code for AI agent coordination
- **Agent Adapters**: Support for various AI agents (GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.)
