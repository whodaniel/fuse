# The New Fuse - HTML/CSS UI Showcase

This directory (`ui-html-css`) contains a static HTML and CSS representation of the core user interface pages for "The New Fuse" platform. Its purpose is to provide a visual and structural prototype of the application's front-end design before full-stack development or integration with a JavaScript framework.

## Purpose

*   **Visual Prototyping:** To quickly iterate on the look and feel of the application.
*   **Structural Blueprint:** To define the basic HTML structure of different views.
*   **Component Demonstration:** To showcase common UI elements like navigation, forms, cards, and tables.
*   **Early Feedback:** To gather feedback on UI/UX from stakeholders.

## How to View

1.  Clone or download this repository/directory.
2.  Navigate to the `ui-html-css` directory in your file explorer.
3.  Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
    *   This `index.html` file serves as a central hub, providing links to all other application pages.

Alternatively, you can open individual `.html` files from the `ui-html-css/pages/` subdirectory directly in your browser.

## Key Pages Included

The `pages/` subdirectory contains the individual HTML files for different sections of the application:

*   **`home.html`**: The main landing/welcome page for authenticated users.
*   **`login.html`**: User login page.
*   **`register.html`**: User registration page.
*   **`dashboard.html`**: Main user dashboard with an overview of activities.
*   **`chat.html`**: Interface for interacting with AI agents or other users.
*   **`tasks.html`**: Page for managing tasks.
*   **`workflows.html`**: Page for managing and visualizing workflows.
*   **`admin.html`**: Main dashboard for administrative functions.
    *   **`admin-users.html`**: Admin page for user management.
    *   **`admin-system-settings.html`**: Admin page for system-wide settings.
    *   **`admin-agents.html`**: Admin page for configuring AI agents.
*   **`agents.html`**: User-facing page to discover and interact with available AI agents.
*   **`suggestions.html`**: Page to display AI-generated suggestions to the user.
*   **`settings.html`**: User-specific settings and profile management.

## Styling

Basic CSS is included within each HTML file's `<style>` tags for simplicity in this static showcase. The styling aims for:
*   A clean and modern look.
*   Consistency across pages (shared navigation, footer, container styles).
*   Basic responsiveness for different screen sizes (though not exhaustively tested for all devices).

## Limitations

*   **Static Content:** All data is hardcoded. There is no dynamic functionality or backend interaction.
*   **No JavaScript:** Interactions are limited to what HTML and CSS can provide (e.g., form submissions are conceptual).
*   **Simplified Responsiveness:** While some responsive design principles are used, it's not a fully responsive, production-ready design.
*   **Conceptual API Endpoints:** Form actions point to placeholder API endpoints (e.g., `/api/...`) for illustrative purposes.

This showcase is intended as a foundational visual guide.
