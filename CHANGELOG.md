- Integrated functionality from separate utility files (fs-utils, webview-utils, uri-utils, vscode-utils) directly into relevant components

### Bug Fixes

- **Date:** 2025-05-13
- **Title:** Resolved `yarn install` failure due to missing plugin
  **Description:**
  The `yarn install` command was consistently failing with the error: "Internal Error: Cannot find module '/Users/danielgoldberg/Desktop/A1-Inter-LLM-Com/The New Fuse/.yarn/plugins/@yarnpkg/plugin-workspace-tools.cjs'".
  This issue was traced back to a conflict with an explicit plugin configuration within the [`.yarnrc.yml`](./.yarnrc.yml) file.
  The resolution involved removing the `plugins` section from the [`.yarnrc.yml`](./.yarnrc.yml) file. After this change, `yarn install` completes successfully, although some peer dependency warnings remain (these are separate and were present after the fix).

### Improvements

- Updated Chrome extension to support both ws:// and wss:// protocols
- Improved logging in both Chrome extension and VS Code extension
- Enhanced client tracking with unique identifiers
- Updated documentation with secure WebSocket configuration instructions
- Improved error messages and troubleshooting information
