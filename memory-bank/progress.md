# Progress

*   **What Works (Based on recent log entries, architecture & FTUE Report - May 2025):**
    *   **Core Documentation Structure:** Initial `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`, `AI_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md`, `MASTER_INFORMATION_ARCHITECTURE.md` established. Logging utilities exist.
    *   **Onboarding Wizard (Initial):** Enhanced wizard UI implemented with user/agent paths and AI assistant (GreeterAgent, simulated RAG). (FTUE: Structured Onboarding noted as a strength).
    *   **VS Code Extension - WebSocket Communication (Initial):** Integrated WebSocket server for Chrome extension communication (port 3710). Enhanced with secure WSS support, multiple client handling, and improved reconnection. Chrome extension options page created. (FTUE: Core VS Code Integration via WebSocket noted as a strength).
    *   **Architectural Foundation:** Solid architectural concepts defined (Agent, MCPContext, A2AMessage, Workflow). (FTUE: Solid Architectural Foundation noted as a strength).
*   **What's Left to Build (Based on recent log entries, architecture & FTUE Report - May 2025):**
    *   **Core End-to-End Feature Slice (FTUE Recommendation):** Implement a simple but complete workflow involving basic agent discovery, coordination, and task execution, manageable through the VS Code interface.
    *   **Onboarding Wizard Enhancements (FTUE Recommendation):** Implement actual RAG, backend integration (user registration/profile), input validation, API endpoints for agent registration.
    *   **Core Agent/Workflow Functionality:** Full implementation of agent registration, discovery, capability handling, A2A communication logic, workflow execution engine.
    *   **WebSocket Enhancements:** Message compression, rate limiting, enhanced authentication (token validation), custom domain support, clustering.
    *   **Federated Agent Networks:** Future goal.
    *   **Edge Deployment:** Future goal.
    *   **AI-powered Workflow Optimization:** Future goal.
    *   **Enhanced Privacy Mechanisms:** Future goal.
    *   **Blockchain Integration:** Future goal.
*   **Current Status (Incorporating FTUE Report - May 2025):**
    *   **Foundational Stage:** Core architecture defined (`MASTER_INFORMATION_ARCHITECTURE.md`). Key entry points (Onboarding Wizard UI, VS Code extension with Chrome WebSocket communication) are in place, suggesting a positive initial setup experience.
    *   **Key Communication Channel:** WebSocket between VS Code and Chrome extension established and secured (WSS).
    *   **Documentation Practices:** Established.
    *   **Pending Core Functionality:** Full realization of core functionalities (agent discovery, coordination, workflow automation, RAG in onboarding) is pending significant further development. Many features are conceptual or in early UI/communication-layer implementation.
    *   **Next Priority:** Focus on implementing a core end-to-end feature slice and accelerating onboarding enhancements as per FTUE recommendations.
*   **Known Issues (Incorporating FTUE Report - May 2025):**
    *   **Incomplete Core Functionality:** Onboarding wizard uses simulated RAG; needs real implementation and backend integration. Agent discovery, coordination, and workflow execution are not yet fully functional. (FTUE Report)
    *   **WebSocket Server Enhancements Needed:** Requires compression, rate limiting, improved authentication, etc. (FTUE Report)
    *   [Specific bugs not detailed in reviewed docs, but `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` mentions challenges addressed during implementation, e.g., SSL management, protocol compatibility.]
*   **Consolidated UX Considerations (from UX Evaluations - May 2025):**
    *   **Complexity Overwhelm & Discoverability:** The sheer number of features (indicated by file structure and FTUE) could be overwhelming if not introduced progressively. Advanced features/configurations might be hard to find without explicit guidance. (Both evaluations)
    *   **Consistency between Web UI and VS Code Extension:** Ensuring a seamless and consistent experience between any web application and the VS Code integrated UI is crucial. Discrepancies in functionality or design could lead to confusion. (File-structure UX Eval)
    *   **Performance of VS Code Extension:** A feature-rich VS Code extension could impact IDE performance if not carefully optimized. (Both evaluations)
    *   **Clarity of "Agent" vs. "User" Paths in Onboarding:** The clarity of tailored paths in the Onboarding Wizard (e.g., `UserTypeDetection.tsx`) is key for different user personas. (File-structure UX Eval, reinforced by FTUE's focus on onboarding)
    *   **Incomplete Core Functionality (UX Impact):** Many critical features (full RAG in onboarding, agent discovery/coordination, workflow execution) are not yet fully implemented, limiting the depth of the FTUE beyond initial setup. (FTUE Report)
    *   **Dependency on Further Enhancements (UX Impact):** Robustness of FTUE, especially for VS Code extension (WebSocket) and onboarding (backend integration), depends on planned enhancements. (FTUE Report)
*   **Decision Log:** Detailed decisions and rationales are captured chronologically within `docs/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`. Key architectural decisions are summarized in `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`.
