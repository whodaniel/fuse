# Active Context

*   **Current Focus:** Incorporating the **First-Time User Experience (FTUE) Evaluation Report** into the Memory Bank. Aligning insights from the FTUE report with ongoing development, documentation, and strategic planning.
*   **Recent Changes (Based on `docs/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` as of 2024-07-03 and recent activity):**
    *   **2025-05-17 (Afternoon):** Processed "First-Time User Experience Evaluation Report". Insights and recommendations incorporated into Memory Bank, influencing next steps and priorities.
    *   **2025-05-17 (Morning):** Processed "The New Fuse User Experience Evaluation" (file structure based). Insights incorporated into Memory Bank.
    *   **2024-07-03:** Enhanced WebSocket server (VS Code extension) with secure connections (WSS), multiple client support, and improved reconnection logic. Created Chrome extension options page for configuration. Updated related documentation.
    *   **2024-07-02:** Integrated WebSocket server into VS Code extension for Chrome extension communication (port 3710). Updated Chrome extension to use WebSocket. Created related documentation and troubleshooting guides.
    *   **2024-07-01:** Enhanced onboarding wizard with AI (GreeterAgent, simulated RAG), user/agent paths, and multiple steps.
    *   **2024-07-01:** Created initial `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`, `AI_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md`, and supporting logging utilities/hooks.
*   **Next Steps (Incorporating FTUE Report Recommendations):**
    *   **Prioritize implementing a core end-to-end feature slice:** Focus on a simple but complete workflow involving basic agent discovery, coordination, and task execution, all manageable through the VS Code interface. (From FTUE Report)
    *   **Accelerate onboarding enhancements:** Expedite the implementation of real RAG functionality and necessary backend integrations (user registration, profiles) for the Onboarding Wizard. (From FTUE Report)
    *   **Embed UX considerations proactively into development:** Address complexity management, discoverability, UI/UX consistency, VS Code extension performance, and onboarding clarity as new features are designed and implemented. (From FTUE Report)
    *   Implement message compression for WebSocket.
    *   Add rate limiting to WebSocket.
    *   Enhance WebSocket authentication (token validation).
    *   Support custom domains for secure WebSocket.
    *   Implement WebSocket server clustering.
    *   Continue populating and refining Memory Bank files, ensuring alignment with `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`.
*   **Active Decisions/Considerations:** How to best integrate the Memory Bank concept with the existing `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` workflow. Ensuring Memory Bank updates capture the necessary context without duplicating the log excessively. Prioritizing development efforts based on FTUE report recommendations.
*   **Important Patterns/Preferences:** Strong emphasis on documentation (central log, guides, inline comments). Use of TypeScript. Modular architecture. Use of specific communication protocols (MCP, A2A, WebSocket). VS Code extension is a key component. Iterative development informed by UX evaluations.
*   **Learnings/Insights:**
    *   The project already has a robust documentation culture centered around `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`. The Memory Bank serves a similar purpose but provides a more structured, categorized view of the project state.
    *   MCP is central to the architecture.
    *   The initial UX evaluation (file structure based) confirmed that the file structure strongly supports the intended UX but highlighted potential pain points around complexity, discoverability, UI consistency, VS Code extension performance, and onboarding clarity.
    *   **The FTUE report (May 2025) indicates a foundational stage of development.** Key entry points (Onboarding Wizard, VS Code extension with Chrome communication via WebSockets) are in place, suggesting an initial positive setup experience.
    *   **Full realization of core functionalities (agent coordination, workflow automation, RAG in onboarding) is pending significant further development.** Many features are conceptual or in early implementation.
    *   The FTUE report reinforces the critical need to address potential complexity and discoverability issues as the system grows.
    *   The VS Code extension's WebSocket communication is a key strength but requires the planned enhancements (compression, rate limiting, improved auth) to be robust.
