# The New Fuse - Cleanup Execution Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step process for executing the final cleanup and consolidation of The New Fuse codebase.

## Phase 1: Assessment (Day 1-2)

### 1. Run the analysis scripts
```bash
# Run the initial analysis script to identify issues
node scripts/cleanup.js > cleanup-results.txt

# Review the results and update the cleanup plan accordingly
```

### 2. Create inventory of components and modules
- List all existing components
- Document their current usage
- Identify potential redundancies
- Map dependencies between components

### 3. Update cleanup plan with specific items
- Review `cleanup-results.txt` 
- Add specific items to the cleanup plan in each category
- Prioritize tasks based on impact and complexity

## Phase 2: Documentation Alignment (Day 3-4)

### 1. Update all README files
- Ensure they reflect the current state of each module
- Standardize format according to component-standards.md
- Verify all setup instructions are accurate

### 2. Review and update JSDoc comments
- Run a documentation generation tool to identify gaps
- Add missing documentation to components and functions
- Ensure parameter descriptions are accurate

### 3. Update architecture diagrams
- Create/update diagrams to reflect current architecture
- Include main data flows and component relationships
- Store in `/docs/architecture/`

## Phase 3: Code Consolidation (Day 5-7)

### 1. Eliminate redundant utilities
- Consolidate duplicate functions into shared utilities
- Update imports across the codebase
- Ensure backward compatibility where needed

### 2. Standardize interfaces and types
- Create consistent naming patterns
- Move shared types to dedicated type files
- Ensure proper export/import patterns for tree-shaking

### 3. Merge similar components
- Identify component pairs/groups with similar functionality
- Create parameterized versions to replace duplicates
- Update all references to use the consolidated components

## Phase 4: Optimization (Day 8-9)

### 1. Run the final cleanup script
```bash
# Execute the final cleanup script
node scripts/final-cleanup.js
```

### 2. Review and approve changes
- Check the generated `unused-files.txt`
- Validate that removed code doesn't break functionality
- Manually verify critical components still work

### 3. Update build configuration
- Implement tree-shaking optimizations in build tools
- Configure bundle analysis tools
- Verify bundle size reduction

## Phase 5: Testing and Verification (Day 10)

### 1. Run full test suite
```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

### 2. Fix any broken tests
- Update tests to match new implementations
- Add tests for consolidated components
- Ensure coverage meets standards

### 3. Final verification
- Complete the checklist in cleanup-plan.md
- Document any remaining technical debt
- Create follow-up tasks for any items that couldn't be addressed

## Tracking Progress

Use the following format to track progress on each task:

```
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Pending task
  - Current status: In progress
  - Blockers: None
  - Next steps: Complete by EOD
```

## Daily Check-ins

Schedule a daily 15-minute check-in to review:
1. What was completed yesterday
2. What will be worked on today
3. Any blockers or issues
4. Adjustments to the plan

## Rollback Plan

In case issues arise:
1. Maintain a git branch with the pre-cleanup state
2. Document any critical changes that cannot be easily reverted
3. Create snapshots before major consolidation steps
