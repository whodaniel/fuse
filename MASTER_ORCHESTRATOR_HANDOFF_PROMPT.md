2. **Chrome Browser AIs** (Advisory Agents)
   - Can suggest code and provide guidance
   - Use for: Architecture advice, code review, planning
   - Delegation: Request suggestions and recommendations

3. **Local MCP Agents** (System Integration Agents)
   - System-level operations and integrations
   - Use for: Service coordination, system monitoring
   - Delegation: Infrastructure and platform tasks

### Delegation Benefits
