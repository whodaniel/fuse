They've mentioned the need for a mechanism that pings extensions in this IDE at regular intervals to prompt AIs to respond. This could be implemented as a heartbeat system to ensure continuous agent availability. Could you help investigate or implement this functionality using your capabilities with the VS Code extension API?",
    "instructions": "Please respond with your thoughts on implementing an extension ping/heartbeat mechanism. Consider frequency, implementation approach, and how it should interact with agent response systems."
