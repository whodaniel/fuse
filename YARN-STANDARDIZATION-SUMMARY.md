## Verified Changes
- All package.json files now consistently use Yarn 4.9.1
- Shell scripts have been updated to use the standardized approach
- Docker builds will use the correct version
- Documentation has been updated for consistency

## Post-Standardization Instructions

1. **Reinstall Dependencies**
   ```bash
   ./use-project-yarn.sh install
   ```

2. **Adding New Dependencies**
   Always use the helper script instead of calling Yarn directly:
   ```bash
   ./add-dependency.sh [package-name]
   ```

3. **Running Yarn Commands**
   Always use the wrapper script:
   ```bash
   ./use-project-yarn.sh [command]
   ```

4. **Checking for Conflicts**
   Periodically verify Yarn versions with:
   ```bash
   ./check-yarn-conflicts.sh
   ```

5. **Onboarding New Team Members**
   Direct them to `YARN-SETUP.md` for setup instructions
